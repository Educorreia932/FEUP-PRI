How could you run off on us?\nYou feel like God inside that gold\nI found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair\nI found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra\n\nRemove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb\nOur war is over, our queen has met her doom\nNo more, she lives no more, serpent in her room\nNo more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra\n\n\nBig sun coming strong through the motel blinds\nWake up to your girl\nFor now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra\nI watch you fix your hair\nThen put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra\nThen your lipstick, Cleopatra\nThen your six-inch heels, catch her\nShe's headed to the pyramid\n\nShe's working at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\n\nPimping in my convos\nBubbles in my champagne, let it be some jazz playing\nTop floor motel suite twisting my cigars\nFloor model TV with the VCR\nGot rubies in my damn chain\nWhip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain\nGot your girl working for me\nHit the strip and my bills paid\nThat keep my bills paid\nHit the strip and my bills paid\nKeep a nigga bills paid\n\nShe's working at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\n\nYou showed up after work, I'm bathing your body\nTouch you in places only I know\nYou're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater\nCan we make love before you go?\nThe way you say my name makes me feel like\nI'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed\nYou say it's big but you take it, ride cowgirl\nBut your love ain't free no more, baby\nBut your love ain't free no more\n\nShe's working at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid, that's right\nWorking at the pyramid tonight, yeah\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nWorking at the pyramid\nWorking at the pyramid tonight\nAir guitar",

bruh\n\n\nPussy got juicy when she introduced me\nI don't got no whip but she said she gon' scoop me\nShe gave me the key to it, Quavo and Lucci\nI can't rock no Gucci\nI can't go out goofy\nI came out the coochie a K9, I roof\nWhen I say I'm the truth then I say I am truly\nIf I gotta move then they gon' have to move me\nMy big homie stay with that tool like a roomie\nNo, they won't pick on me if it's a clip on me\nCook 'em like chicken meat, Tyson, no Cicely\nI'm on the winning team, might wanna stick with me\nI pull a string and it might make a symphony\nI see her signaling, know she wanna lick on me\nShe gon' hit on me 'til she can sit on me\nI heard your new shit but no I wasn't listening\nNo, I don't link with cliques\nNo, I don't click on links...\n(Ayy, yo I be rapping and shit bruh, fuck with my shit)\nBoy, my hair way too long for the cap\nAll my energy go in these raps\nAll your energy go in an app\nI'm an EBT baby, I DDT'd every beat that they gave me too easily\nCame in mischievous, made your miss eat the dick\nAll the ingredients made me a genius\nI'ma double my W's working\nEverything that you see in these verses\nIs the same when you see me in person\nI'm on level two, levitate over you\nNever wait on the move, heavyweight folding you\nHeaven came over you, feathers take over you\nKenny came over, you let him takeover you, bet\n\nSee, I had a hook, I had the mel-\nI just gotta goddamn remember that shit...\nIf I roll up these pussy niggas gon fold up...\nAight, I got it\n\nAnd I know\nIf we roll up, these pussy niggas gon' fold up\nWhere you finna go, bruh?\nGet a nigga something from the store, bruh\nIf we roll up, these pussy niggas gon' fold up\nWhere you finna go, bruh?\nGet a nigga something from the store, bruh\n\nI had to let these niggas know I'm going hard as ever man\nNew shit on the way\nNew whips on the way\n\nR.I.P Bank\n\n\nWay before living it, I would escape to envision it\nWeigh up the differences, stay up for days until distances\nCame up with differences, shaving the length of it, listening\nAging with wisdom, an agent of criminal influence\nPaying attention to data\nWas caged in Decatur with cannibals, killers, and cableless\nInterfaces, face it, ain’t no one hearing this, falling\nPrey to appearances, pray to a pyramid\nRage in my rhythm, Sega, my genesis\nShaking my zip, and it’s saving my mental from breaking\nCaving and crippling\nScribbling into my pages, and paving my destiny\nPicturing pitiful places and painting soliloquies\nPain in my angry delivery, made 'em attentive\nSee angels cling to my pen and keep claiming my energy\nCame and gave me the crown, gave me the crown, saved me\nGreatness my tendency, I train at it endlessly\nAin’t wanna make it if I made it pretending, I see\nSome niggas that wake up and portray who they wish they could be\nCouldn’t be me, I’m so A, it’s a shame and I think\nI used to say if I'm the greatest for 10, I’m at peace\nI think I want this shit forever right now\n\nI want this shit forever and now, forever and now\nI want this shit forever and now\nI want this shit forever and now\nI want this\n\nWay before living it, I would escape to envision it\nChanging the shit they would say, I became a revisionist\nCame with a vivid display of the pain that my niggas lived\nDaily with diligence, babies with triggers would trigger it\nTraining my senses to aim at escaping my ignorance\nTaming my temper, this chain on me changing my temperature\nAlien Jigga, today they gon' take me as serious\nTake me to Sirius, angel affiliates\nLanguages explain my experience, praise 'em\nI chose believing in myself when you wouldn’t believe me\nNow when I start to taste success, you assume that I’m greedy\nI don’t agree with what you doing, you view it as devious\nBut you confuse being cool with obedience\nLosing my lenience, moving with meaning\nIt’s two of me, and truthfully, this duality the root of my genius\nAngels is hoodrats, 'pending on the angle you look at\nHanging with crooks, black straps came with the book bags\nI was playing hooky just to work on my real craft\nAnd to this day, I wake up and still craft it\nEvery line you hear crafted to give you chills after\nI know shit get real, it’s a gift that I’m still rapping\nSome niggas quit crafting, artists that I model my pen after\nI seen they mistakes and I split patterns\nSplit paths and ran into my destiny years after\nI feel as if I'm meant to have this shit forever right now\n\nI want this shit forever and now, forever and now\nI want this shit forever and now\nI want this shit\n\n\nTee!\nWanna rock with a nigga from the three—, three\nShawty wanna rock with a\nShawty—, shawty wanna rock with a nigga from the three—, three—, three\nShawty wanna rock with a—, s—shawty wanna rock with a\nShawty wanna rock with a nigga from the three—, three\nShawty wanna rock with a\nShawty—, shawty wanna rock with a nigga from the three—, three—, three\nShawty wanna rock with a—, s—shawty wanna rock with a\n\nI took the dog off the chain\nI put the dog on my chain\nI put the Glock in my name\nI put some guap into savings\nMy bitch, she sexy as fuck\nMy pistol sexy as fuck\nMy nigga extra as fuck\nYou disrespecting, it's up\n\nHeavenly pup\nNever quit levelin' up\nPedal to metal, I'm melded and welded in metal, my skeleton's struck\nMet with the devil in Hell and we head on to Hell and we is in my truck\nHeld it and felt the lil' rush\nSent a few shells in the bush\n\n.40 got kick\n.40 got kick\n.40 got kick\nYeah\nThis .40 got kick,

Wayne's world\nPlanet Rock, panties drop\nAnd the tops and she gonna rock 'til the camera stop\nAnd I sing about angels like Angela (rock) and Pamela (rock)\nAnd Samantha (rock) and Amanda and Tamara\nI'm in here up like bitch what's up\nMechanic, me, I can fix you up\nI can fuck you up, I can fuck you down\nShorty we can go wherever just pick a town\nAnd the jewelry is louder than an engine sound\nBig ass rocks like on the ground\nDirty like socks that's on the ground, Weezy\n\nJust let it rock\nLet it rock, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock\nI'm back like I forgot something, I'm something\nRollin' Rock rubbing rap running\nMiles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach\nLike Wayne the personal trainer\nMy aim is perfect I'll fuck ya, period, like the reminder\nI wish I could be, as cruel as you\nAnd I wish I could say, the things you do\nBut I can't and I won't live a lie, no not this time",
