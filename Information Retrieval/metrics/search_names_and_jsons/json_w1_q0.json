          "lyrics":"In the spring of 1829, the author of this work, whom curiosity had brought into Spain, made a rambling expedition from Seville to Granada in company with a friend, a member of the Russian Embassy at Madrid. Accident had thrown us together from distant regions of the globe, and a similarity of taste led us to wander together among the romantic mountains of Andalusia. Should these pages meet his eye, wherever thrown by the duties of his station, whether mingling in the pageantry of courts, or meditating on the truer glories of nature, may they recall the scenes of our adventurous companionship, and with them the recollection of one, in whom neither time nor distance will obliterate the remembrance of his gentleness and worth.\nAnd here, before setting forth, let me indulge in a few previous remarks on Spanish scenery and Spanish travelling. Many are apt to picture Spain to their imaginations as a soft southern region, decked out with the luxuriant charms of voluptuous Italy. On the contrary, though there are exceptions in some of the maritime provinces, yet, for the greater part, it is a stern, melancholy country, with rugged mountains, and long sweeping plains, destitute of trees, and indescribably silent and lonesome, partaking of the savage and solitary character of Africa. What adds to this silence and loneliness, is the absence of singing birds, a natural consequence of the want of groves and hedges. The vulture and the eagle are seen wheeling about the mountain-cliffs, and soaring over the plains, and groups of shy bustards stalk about the heaths; but the myriads of smaller birds, which animate the whole face of other countries, are met with in but few provinces in Spain, and in those chiefly among the orchards and gardens which surround the habitations of man.\nIn the interior provinces the traveller occasionally traverses great tracts cultivated with grain as far as the eye can reach, waving at times with verdure, at other times naked and sunburnt, but he looks round in vain for the hand that has tilled the soil. At length, he perceives some village on a steep hill, or rugged crag, with mouldering battlements and ruined watchtower; a strong-hold, in old times, against civil war, or Moorish inroad; for the custom among the peasantry of congregating together for mutual protection is still kept up in most parts of Spain, in consequence of the maraudings of roving freebooters.\nBut though a great part of Spain is deficient in the garniture of groves and forests, and the softer charms of ornamental cultivation, yet its scenery is noble in its severity, and in unison with the attributes of its people; and I think that I better understand the proud, hardy, frugal and abstemious Spaniard, his manly defiance of hardships, and contempt of effeminate indulgences, since I have seen the country he inhabits.\nThere is something too, in the sternly simple features of the Spanish landscape, that impresses on the soul a feeling of sublimity. The immense plains of the Castiles and of La Mancha, extending as far as the eye can reach, derive an interest from their very nakedness and immensity, and possess, in some degree, the solemn grandeur of the ocean. In ranging over these boundless wastes, the eye catches sight here and there of a straggling herd of cattle attended by a lonely herdsman, motionless as a statue, with his long slender pike tapering up like a lance into the air; or, beholds a long train of mules slowly moving along the waste like a train of camels in the desert; or, a single horseman, armed with blunderbuss and stiletto, and prowling over the plain. Thus the country, the habits, the very looks of the people, have something of the Arabian character. The general insecurity of the country is evinced in the universal use of weapons. The herdsman in the field, the shepherd in the plain, has his musket and his knife. The wealthy villager rarely ventures to the market-town without his trabuco, and, perhaps, a servant on foot with a blunderbuss on his shoulder; and the most petty journey is undertaken with the preparation of a warlike enterprise.\nThe dangers of the road produce also a mode of travelling, resembling, on a diminutive scale, the caravans of the east. The arrieros, or carriers, congregate in convoys, and set off in large and well-armed trains on appointed days; while additional travellers swell their number, and contribute to their strength. In this primitive way is the commerce of the country carried on. The muleteer is the general medium of traffic, and the legitimate traverser of the land, crossing the peninsula from the Pyrenees and the Asturias to the Alpuxarras, the Serrania de Ronda, and even to the gates of Gibraltar. He lives frugally and hardily: his alforjas of coarse cloth hold his scanty stock of provisions; a leathern bottle, hanging at his saddle-bow, contains wine or water, for a supply across barren mountains and thirsty plains; a mule-cloth spread upon the ground is his bed at night, and his pack-saddle his pillow. His low, but clean-limbed and sinewy form betokens strength; his complexion is dark and sunburnt; his eye resolute, but quiet in its expression, except when kindled by sudden emotion; his demeanor is frank, manly, and courteous, and he never passes you without a grave salutation: âDios guarde a usted!â âVa usted con Dios, Caballero!â (âGod guard you!â âGod be with you, Cavalier!â)\nAs these men have often their whole fortune at stake upon the burden of their mules, they have their weapons at hand, slung to their saddles, and ready to be snatched out for desperate defence; but their united numbers render them secure against petty bands of marauders, and the solitary bandolero, armed to the teeth, and mounted on his Andalusian steed, hovers about them, like a pirate about a merchant convoy, without daring to assault.\nThe Spanish muleteer has an inexhaustible stock of songs and ballads, with which to beguile his incessant wayfaring. The airs are rude and simple, consisting of but few inflections. These he chants forth with a loud voice, and long, drawling cadence, seated sideways on his mule, who seems to listen with infinite gravity, and to keep time, with his paces, to the tune. The couplets thus chanted, are often old traditional romances about the Moors, or some legend of a saint, or some love-ditty; or, what is still more frequent, some ballad about a bold contrabandista, or hardy bandolero, for the smuggler and the robber are poetical heroes among the common people of Spain. Often, the song of the muleteer is composed at the instant, and relates to some local scene, or some incident of the journey. This talent of singing and improvising is frequent in Spain, and is said to have been inherited from the Moors. There is something wildly pleasing in listening to these ditties among the rude and lonely scenes they illustrate; accompanied, as they are, by the occasional jingle of the mule-bell.\nIt has a most picturesque effect also to meet a train of muleteers in some mountain-pass. First you hear the bells of the leading mules, breaking with their simple melody the stillness of the airy height; or, perhaps, the voice of the muleteer admonishing some tardy or wandering animal, or chanting, at the full stretch of his lungs, some traditionary ballad. At length you see the mules slowly winding along the cragged defile, sometimes descending precipitous cliffs, so as to present themselves in full relief against the sky, sometimes toiling up the deep arid chasms below you. As they approach, you descry their gay decorations of worsted stuffs, tassels, and saddle-cloths, while, as they pass by, the ever-ready trabuco, slung behind the packs and saddles, gives a hint of the insecurity of the road.\nThe ancient kingdom of Granada, into which we* were about to penetrate, is one of the most mountainous regions of Spain. Vast sierras, or chains of mountains, destitute of shrub or tree, and mottled with variegated marbles and granites, elevate their sunburnt summits against a deep-blue sky; yet in their rugged bosoms lie ingulfed verdant and fertile valleys, where the desert and the garden strive for mastery, and the very rock is, as it were, compelled to yield the fig, the orange, and the citron, and to blossom with the myrtle and the rose.\n* Note to the Revised Edition.â The Author feels at liberty to mention that his travelling companion was the Prince Dolgorouki, at present Russian minister at the Court of Persia.\nIn the wild passes of these mountains the sight of walled towns and villages, built like eaglesâ nests among the cliffs, and surrounded by Moorish battlements, or of ruined watchtowers perched on lofty peaks, carries the mind back to the chivalric days of Christian and Moslem warfare, and to the romantic struggle for the conquest of Granada. In traversing these lofty sierras the traveller is often obliged to alight, and lead his horse up and down the steep and jagged ascents and descents, resembling the broken steps of a staircase.\nSometimes the road winds along dizzy precipices, without parapet to guard him from the gulfs below, and then will plunge down steep, and dark, and dangerous declivities. Sometimes it struggles through rugged barrancos, or ravines, worn by winter torrents, the obscure path of the contrabandista; while, ever and anon, the ominous cross, the monument of robbery and murder, erected on a mound of stones at some lonely part of the road, admonishes the traveller that he is among the haunts of banditti, perhaps at that very moment under the eye of some lurking bandolero. Sometimes, in winding through the narrow valleys, he is startled by a hoarse bellowing, and beholds above him on some green fold of the mountain a herd of fierce Andalusian bulls, destined for the combat of the arena. I have felt, if I may so express it, an agreeable horror in thus contemplating, near at hand, these terrific animals, clothed with tremendous strength, and ranging their native pastures in untamed wildness, strangers almost to the face of man: they know no one but the solitary herdsman who attends upon them, and even he at times dares not venture to approach them. The low bellowing of these bulls, and their menacing aspect as they look down from their rocky height, give additional wildness to the savage scenery.\nI have been betrayed unconsciously into a longer disquisition than I intended on the general features of Spanish travelling; but there is a romance about all the recollections of the Peninsula dear to the imagination.\nAs our proposed route to Granada lay through mountainous regions, where the roads are little better than mule paths, and said to be frequently beset by robbers, we took due travelling precautions. Forwarding the most valuable part of our luggage a day or two in advance by the arrieros, we retained merely clothing and necessaries for the journey and money for the expenses of the road, with a little surplus of hard dollars by way of robber purse, to satisfy the gentlemen of the road should we be assailed. Unlucky is the too wary traveller who, having grudged this precaution, falls into their clutches empty handed: they are apt to give him a sound ribroasting for cheating them out of their dues. âCaballeros like them cannot afford to scour the roads and risk the gallows for nothing.â\nA couple of stout steeds were provided for our own mounting, and a third for our scanty luggage and the conveyance of a sturdy Biscayan lad, about twenty years of age, who was to be our guide, our groom, our valet, and at all times our guard. For the latter office he was provided with a formidable trabuco or carbine, with which he promised to defend us against rateros or solitary footpads; but as to powerful bands, like that of the âsons of Ecija,â he confessed they were quite beyond his prowess. He made much vainglorious boast about his weapon at the outset of the journey, though, to the discredit of his generalship, it was suffered to hang unloaded behind his saddle.\nAccording to our stipulations, the man from whom we hired the horses was to be at the expense of their feed and stabling on the journey, as well as of the maintenance of our Biscayan squire, who of course was provided with funds for the purpose; we took care, however, to give the latter a private hint, that, though we made a close bargain with his master, it was all in his favor, as, if he proved a good man and true, both he and the horses should live at our cost, and the money provided for their maintenance remain in his pocket. This unexpected largess, with the occasional present of a cigar, won his heart completely. He was, in truth, a faithful, cheery, kind-hearted creature, as full of saws and proverbs as that miracle of squires, the renowned Sancho himself, whose name, by the by, we bestowed upon him, and like a true Spaniard, though treated by us with companionable familiarity, he never for a moment, in his utmost hilarity, overstepped the bounds of respectful decorum.\nSuch were our minor preparations for the journey, but above all we laid in an ample stock of good humor, and a genuine disposition to be pleased, determining to travel in true contrabandista style, taking things as we found them, rough or smooth, and mingling with all classes and conditions in a kind of vagabond companionship. It is the true way to travel in Spain. With such disposition and determination, what a country is it for a traveller, where the most miserable inn is as full of adventure as an enchanted castle, and every meal is in itself an achievement! Let others repine at the lack of turnpike roads and sumptuous hotels, and all the elaborate comforts of a country cultivated and civilized into tameness and commonplace; but give me the rude mountain scramble; the roving, haphazard, wayfaring; the half wild, yet frank and hospitable manners, which impart such a true game flavor to dear old romantic Spain!\nThus equipped and attended, we cantered out of âFair Seville cityâ at half-past six in the morning of a bright May day, in company with a lady and gentleman of our acquaintance, who rode a few miles with us, in the Spanish mode of taking leave. Our route lay through old Alcala de Guadaira (Alcala on the river Aira), the benefactress of Seville, that supplies it with bread and water. Here live the bakers who furnish Seville with that delicious bread for which it is renowned; here are fabricated those roscas well known by the well-merited appellation of pan de Dios (bread of God), with which, by the way, we ordered our man, Sancho, to stock his alforjas for the journey. Well has this beneficent little city been denominated the âOven of Sevilleâ; well has it been called Alcala de los Panaderos (Alcala of the bakers), for a great part of its inhabitants are of that handicraft, and the highway hence to Seville is constantly traversed by lines of mules and donkeys laden with great panniers of loaves and roscas.\nI have said Alcala supplies Seville with water. Here are great tanks or reservoirs, of Roman and Moorish construction, whence water is conveyed to Seville by noble aqueducts. The springs of Alcala are almost as much vaunted as its ovens; and to the lightness, sweetness, and purity of its water is attributed in some measure the delicacy of its bread.\nHere we halted for a time, at the ruins of the old Moorish castle, a favorite resort for picnic parties from Seville, where we had passed many a pleasant hour. The walls are of great extent, pierced with loopholes; inclosing a huge square tower or keep, with the remains of masmoras, or subterranean granaries. The Guadaira winds its stream round the hill, at the foot of these ruins, whimpering among reeds, rushes, and pond-lilies, and overhung with rhododendron, eglantine, yellow myrtle, and a profusion of wild flowers and aromatic shrubs; while along its banks are groves of oranges, citrons, and pomegranates, among which we heard the early note of the nightingale.\nA picturesque bridge was thrown across the little river, at one end of which was the ancient Moorish mill of the castle, defended by a tower of yellow stone; a fishermanâs net hung against the wall to dry, and hard by in the river was his boat; a group of peasant women in bright-colored dresses, crossing the arched bridge, were reflected in the placid stream. Altogether it was an admirable scene for a landscape painter.\nThe old Moorish mills, so often found on secluded streams, are characteristic objects in Spanish landscape, and suggestive of the perilous times of old. They are of stone, and often in the form of towers with loopholes and battlements, capable of defence in those warlike days when the country on both sides of the border was subject to sudden inroad and hasty ravage, and when men had to labor with their weapons at hand, and some place of temporary refuge.\nOur next halting place was at Gandul, where were the remains of another Moorish castle, with its ruined tower, a nestling place for storks, and commanding a view over a vast campina or fertile plain, with the mountains of Ronda in the distance. These castles were strong-holds to protect the plains from the talas or forays to which they were subject, when the fields of corn would be laid waste, the flocks and herds swept from the vast pastures, and, together with captive peasantry, hurried off in long cavalgadas across the borders.\nAt Gandul we found a tolerable posada; the good folks could not tell us what time of day it was â the clock only struck once in the day, two hours after noon; until that time it was guesswork. We guessed it was full time to eat; so, alighting, we ordered a repast. While that was in preparation we visited the palace once the residence of the Marquis of Gandul. All was gone to decay; there were but two or three rooms habitable, and very poorly furnished. Yet here were the remains of grandeur: a terrace, where fair dames and gentle cavaliers may once have walked; a fish-pond and ruined garden, with grape-vines and date-bearing palm-trees. Here we were joined by a fat curate, who gathered a bouquet of roses and presented it, very gallantly, to the lady who accompanied us.\nBelow the palace was the mill, with orange-trees and aloes in front, and a pretty stream of pure water. We took a seat in the shade, and the millers, all leaving their work, sat down and smoked with us; for the Andalusians are always ready for a gossip. They were waiting for the regular visit of the barber, who came once a week to put all their chins in order. He arrived shortly afterwards: a lad of seventeen, mounted on a donkey, eager to display his new alforjas or saddle-bags, just bought at a fair; price one dollar, to be paid on St. Johnâs day (in June), by which time he trusted to have mown beards enough to put him in funds.\nBy the time the laconic clock of the castle had struck two we had finished our dinner. So, taking leave of our Seville friends, and leaving the millers still under the hands of the barber, we set off on our ride across the campina. It was one of those vast plains, common in Spain, where for miles and miles there is neither house nor tree. Unlucky the traveller who has to traverse it, exposed as we were to heavy and repeated showers of rain. There is no escape nor shelter. Our only protection was our Spanish cloaks, which nearly covered man and horse, but grew heavier every mile. By the time we had lived through one shower we would see another slowly but inevitably approaching; fortunately in the interval there would be an outbreak of bright, warm, Andalusian sunshine, which would make our cloaks send up wreaths of steam, but which partially dried them before the next drenching.\nShortly after sunset we arrived at Arahal, a little town among the hills. We found it in a bustle with a party of miquelets, who were patrolling the country to ferret out robbers. The appearance of foreigners like ourselves was an unusual circumstance in an interior country town; and little Spanish towns of the kind are easily put in a state of gossip and wonderment by such an occurrence. Mine host, with two or three old wiseacre comrades in brown Cloaks, studied our passports in a corner of the posada, while an Alguazil took notes by the dim light of a lamp. The passports were in foreign languages and perplexed them, but our Squire Sancho assisted them in their studies, and magnified our importance with the grandiloquence of a Spaniard. In the mean time the magnificent distribution of a few cigars had won the hearts of all around us; in a little while the whole community seemed put in agitation to make us welcome. The corregidor himself waited upon us, and a great rush-bottomed arm-chair was ostentatiously bolstered into our room by our landlady, for the accommodation of that important personage. The commander of the patrol took supper with us â a lively, talking, laughing Andaluz, who had made a campaign in South America, and recounted his exploits in love and war with much pomp of phrase, vehemence of gesticulation, and mysterious rolling of the eye. He told us that he had a list of all the robbers in the country, and meant to ferret out every motherâs son of them; he offered us at the same time some of his soldiers as an escort. âOne is enough to protect you, senores; the robbers know me, and know my men; the sight of one is enough to spread terror through a whole sierra.â We thanked him for his offer, but assured him, in his own strain, that with the protection of our redoubtable squire, Sancho, we were not afraid of all the ladrones of Andalusia.\nWhile we were supping with our Drawcansir friend, we heard the notes of a guitar, and the click of castanets, and presently a chorus of voices singing a popular air. In fact mine host had gathered together the amateur singers and musicians, and the rustic belles of the neighborhood, and, on going forth, the courtyard or patio of the inn presented a scene of true Spanish festivity. We took our seats with mine host and hostess and the commander of the patrol, under an archway opening into the court; the guitar passed from hand to hand, but a jovial shoemaker was the Orpheus of the place. He was a pleasant-looking fellow, with huge black whiskers; his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. He touched the guitar with masterly skill, and sang a little amorous ditty with an expressive leer at the women, with whom he was evidently a favorite. He afterwards danced a fandango with a buxom Andalusian damsel, to the great delight of the spectators. But none of the females present could compare with mine hostâs pretty daughter, Pepita, who had slipped away and made her toilette for the occasion, and had covered her head with roses; and who distinguished herself in a bolero with a handsome young dragoon. We ordered our host to let wine and refreshment circulate freely among the company, yet, though there was a motley assembly of soldiers, muleteers, and villagers, no one exceeded the bounds of sober enjoyment. The scene was a study for a painter: the picturesque group of dancers, the troopers in their half military dresses, the peasantry wrapped in their brown cloaks; nor must I omit to mention the old meagre Alguazil, in a short black cloak, who took no notice of any thing going on, but sat in a corner diligently writing by the dim light of a huge copper lamp, that might have figured in the days of Don Quixote.\nThe following morning was bright and balmy, as a May morning ought to be, according to the poets. Leaving Arahal at seven oâclock, with all the posada at the door to cheer us off we pursued our way through a fertile country, covered with grain and beautifully verdant; but which in summer, when the harvest is over and the fields parched and brown, must be monotonous and lonely; for, as in our ride of yesterday, there were neither houses nor people to be seen. The latter all congregate in villages and strong-holds among the hills, as if these fertile plains were still subject to the ravages of the Moor.\nAt noon we came to where there was a group of trees, beside a brook in a rich meadow. Here we alighted to make our midday meal. It was really a luxurious spot, among wild flowers and aromatic herbs, with birds singing around us. Knowing the scanty larders of Spanish inns, and the houseless tracts we might have to traverse, we had taken care to have the alforjas of our squire well stocked with cold provisions, and his bota, or leathern bottle, which might hold a gallon, filled to the neck with choice Valdepenas wine.* As we depended more upon these for our well-being than even his trabuco, we exhorted him to be more attentive in keeping them well charged; and I must do him the justice to say that his namesake, the trencher-loving Sancho Panza, was never a more provident purveyor. Though the alforjas and the bota were frequently and vigorously assailed throughout the journey, they had a wonderful power of repletion, our vigilant squire sacking every thing that remained from our repasts at the inns, to supply these junketings by the road-side, which were his delight.\n* It may be as well to note here, that the alforjas are square pockets at each end of a long cloth about a foot and a half wide, formed by turning up its extremities. The cloth is then thrown over the saddle, and the pockets hang on each side like saddle-bags. It is an Arab invention. The bota is a leathern bag or bottle, of portly dimensions, with a narrow neck. It is also oriental. Hence the scriptural caution, which perplexed me in my boyhood, not to put new wine into old bottles.\nOn the present occasion he spread quite a sumptuous variety of remnants on the green-sward before us, graced with an excellent ham brought from Seville; then, taking his seat at a little distance, he solaced himself with what remained in the alforjas. A visit or two to the bota made him as merry and chirruping as a grasshopper filled with dew. On my comparing his contents of the alforjas to Sanchoâs skimming of the flesh-pots at the wedding of Camacho, I found he was well versed in the history of Don Quixote, but, like many of the common people of Spain, firmly believed it to be a true history.\nâAll that happened a long time ago, senor,â said he, with an inquiring look.\nâA very long time,â I replied.\nâI dare say more than a thousand yearsââ still looking dubiously.\nâI dare say not less.â\nThe squire was satisfied. Nothing pleased the simple-hearted varlet more than my comparing him to the renowned Sancho for devotion to the trencher, and he called himself by no other name throughout the journey.\nOur repast being finished, we spread our cloaks on the green-sward under the tree, and took a luxurious siesta in the Spanish fashion. The clouding up of the weather, however, warned us to depart, and a harsh wind sprang up from the southeast. Towards five oâclock we arrived at Osuna, a town of fifteen thousand inhabitants, situated on the side of a hill, with a church and a ruined castle. The posada was outside of the walls; it had a cheerless look. The evening being cold, the inhabitants were crowded round a brasero in a chimney corner; and the hostess was a dry old woman, who looked like a mummy. Every one eyed us askance as we entered, as Spaniards are apt to regard strangers; a cheery, respectful salutation on our part, caballeroing them and touching our sombreros, set Spanish pride at ease; and when we took our seat among them, lit our cigars, and passed the cigar-box round among them, our victory was complete. I have never known a Spaniard, whatever his rank or condition, who would suffer himself to be outdone in courtesy; and to the common Spaniard the present of a cigar (puro) is irresistible. Care, however, must be taken never to offer him a present with an air of superiority and condescension; he is too much of a caballero to receive favors at the cost of his dignity.\nLeaving Osuna at an early hour the next morning, we entered the sierra or range of mountains. The road wound through picturesque scenery, but lonely; and a cross here and there by the road side, the sign of a murder, showed that we were now coming among the ârobber haunts.â This wild and intricate country, with its silent plains and valleys intersected by mountains, has ever been famous for banditti. It was here that Omar Ibn Hassan, a robber-chief among the Moslems, held ruthless sway in the ninth century, disputing dominion even with the caliphs of Cordova. This too was a part of the regions so often ravaged during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella by Ali Atar, the old Moorish alcayde of Loxa, father-in-law of Boabdil, so that it was called Ali Atarâs garden, and here âJose Maria,â famous in Spanish brigand story, had his favorite lurking places.\nIn the course of the day we passed through Fuente la Piedra near a little salt lake of the same name, a beautiful sheet of water, reflecting like a mirror the distant mountains. We now came in sight of Antiquera, that old city of warlike reputation, lying in the lap of the great sierra which runs through Andalusia. A noble vega spread out before it, a picture of mild fertility set in a frame of rocky mountains. Crossing a gentle river we approached the city between hedges and gardens, in which nightingales were pouring forth their evening song. About nightfall we arrived at the gates. Every thing in this venerable city has a decidedly Spanish stamp. It lies too much out of the frequented track of foreign travel to have its old usages trampled out. Here I observed old men still wearing the montero, or ancient hunting cap, once common throughout Spain; while the young men wore the little round-crowned hat, with brim turned up all round, like a cup turned down in its saucer, while the brim was set off with little black tufts like cockades. The women, too, were all in mantillas and basquinas. The fashions of Paris had not reached Antiquera.\nPursuing our course through a spacious street, we put up at the posada of San Fernando. As Antiquera, though a considerable city, is, as I observed, somewhat out of the track of travel, I had anticipated bad quarters and poor fare at the inn. I was agreeably disappointed, therefore, by a supper table amply supplied, and what were still more acceptable, good clean rooms and comfortable beds. Our man, Sancho, felt himself as well off as his namesake, when he had the run of the dukeâs kitchen, and let me know, as I retired for the night, that it had been a proud time for the alforjas.\nEarly in the morning (May 4th) I strolled to the ruins of the old Moorish castle, which itself had been reared on the ruins of a Roman fortress. Here, taking my seat on the remains of a crumbling tower, I enjoyed a grand and varied landscape, beautiful in itself, and full of storied and romantic associations; for I was now in the very heart of the country famous for the chivalrous contests between Moor and Christian. Below me, in its lap of hills, lay the old warrior city so often mentioned in chronicle and ballad. Out of yon gate and down yon hill paraded the band of Spanish cavaliers, of highest rank and bravest bearing, to make that foray during the war and conquest of Granada, which ended in the lamentable massacre among the mountains of Malaga, and laid all Andalusia in mourning. Beyond spread out the vega, covered with gardens and orchards and fields of grain and enamelled meadows, inferior only to the famous vega of Granada. To the right the Rock of the Lovers stretched like a cragged promontory into the plain, whence the daughter of the Moorish alcayde and her lover, when closely pursued, threw themselves in despair.\nThe matin peal from church and convent below me rang sweetly in the morning air, as I descended. The market-place was beginning to throng with the populace, who traffic in the abundant produce of the vega; for this is the mart of an agricultural region. In the market-place were abundance of freshly plucked roses for sale; for not a dame or damsel of Andalusia thinks her gala dress complete without a rose shining like a gem among her raven tresses.\nOn returning to the inn I found our man Sancho, in high gossip with the landlord and two or three of his hangers-on. He had just been telling some marvellous story about Seville, which mine host seemed piqued to match with one equally marvellous about Antiquera. There was once a fountain, he said, in one of the public squares called IL fuente del toro, the fountain of the bull, because the water gushed from the mouth of a bullâs head, carved of stone. Underneath the head was inscribed:\nEN FRENTE DEL TORO\nSE HALLEN TESORO.\n(In front of the bull there is treasure.)\nMany digged in front of the fountain, but lost their labor and found no money. At last one knowing fellow construed the motto a different way. It is in the forehead (frente) of the bull that the treasure is to be found, said he to himself, and I am the man to find it. Accordingly he came late at night, with a mallet, and knocked the head to pieces; and what do you think he found?\nâPlenty of gold and diamonds!â cried Sancho eagerly.\nâHe found nothing,â rejoined mine host dryly; âand he ruined the fountain.â\nHere a great laugh was set up by the landlordâs hangers-on; who considered Sancho completely taken in by what I presume was one of mine hostâs standing jokes.\nLeaving Antiquera at eight Oâclock, we had a delightful ride along the little river, and by gardens and orchards, fragrant with the odors of spring and vocal with the nightingale. Our road passed round the Rock of the Lovers (el Penon de los Enamorados), which rose in a precipice above us. In the course of the morning we passed through Archidona, situated in the breast of a high hill, with a three-pointed mountain towering above it, and the ruins of a Moorish fortress. It was a great toil to ascend a steep stony street leading up into the city, although it bore the encouraging name of Calle Real del Llano (the Royal Street of the Plain), but it was still a greater toil to descend from this mountain city on the other side.\nAt noon we halted in sight of Archidona, in a pleasant little meadow among hills covered with olive-trees. Our cloaks were spread on the grass, under an elm by the side of a bubbling rivulet; our horses were tethered where they might crop the herbage, and Sancho was told to produce his alforjas. He had been unusually silent this morning ever since the laugh raised at his expense, but now his countenance brightened, and he produced his alforjas with an air of triumph. They contained the contributions of four daysâ journeying, but had been signally enriched by the foraging of the previous evening in the plenteous inn at Antiquera; and this seemed to furnish him with a set-off to the banter of mine host.\nEN FRENTE DEL TORO\nSE HALLEN TESORO\nwould he exclaim, with a chuckling laugh, as he drew forth the heterogeneous contents one by one, in a series which seemed to have no end. First came forth a shoulder of roasted kid, very little the worse for wear; then an entire partridge; then a great morsel of salted codfish wrapped in paper; then the residue of a ham; then the half of a pullet, together with several rolls of bread, and a rabble rout of oranges, figs, raisins, and walnuts. His bota also had been recruited with some excellent wine of Malaga. At every fresh apparition from his larder, he would enjoy our ludicrous surprise, throwing himself back on the grass, shouting with laughter, and exclaiming âFrente del toro!â frente del toro! Ah, senores, they thought Sancho a simpleton at Antiquera; but Sancho knew where to find the tesoro.â\nWhile we were diverting ourselves with his simple drollery, a solitary beggar approached, who had almost the look of a pilgrim. He had a venerable gray beard, and was evidently very old, supporting himself on a staff, yet age had not bowed him down; he was tall and erect, and had the wreck of a fine form. He wore a round Andalusian hat, a sheep-skin jacket, and leathern breeches, gaiters, and sandals. His dress, though old and patched, was decent, his demeanor manly, and he addressed us with the grave courtesy that is to be remarked in the lowest Spaniard. We were in a favorable mood for such a visitor; and in a freak of capricious charity gave him some silver, a loaf of fine wheaten bread, and a goblet of our choice wine of Malaga. He received them thankfully, but without any grovelling tribute of gratitude. Tasting the wine, he held it up to the light, with a slight beam of surprise in his eye, then quaffing it off at a draught, âIt is many years,â said he, âsince I have tasted such wine. It is a cordial to an old manâs heart.â Then, looking at the beautiful wheaten loaf, âBendito sea tal pan!â âBlessed be such bread!â So saying, he put it in his wallet. We urged him to eat it on the spot. âNo, senores,â replied he, âthe wine I had either to drink or leave; but the bread I may take home to share with my family.â\nOur man Sancho sought our eye, and reading permission there, gave the old man some of the ample fragments of our repast, on condition, however, that he should sit down and make a meal.\nHe accordingly took his seat at some little distance from us, and began to eat slowly, and with a sobriety and decorum that would have become a hidalgo. There was altogether a measured manner and a quiet self-possession about the old man, that made me think that he had seen better days; his language too, though simple, had occasionally something picturesque and almost poetical in the phraseology. I set him down for some broken-down cavalier. I was mistaken; it was nothing but the innate courtesy of a Spaniard, and the poetical turn of thought and language often to be found in the lowest classes of this clear-witted people. For fifty years, he told us, he had been a shepherd, but now he was out of employ and destitute. âWhen I was a young man,â said he, ânothing could harm or trouble me; I was always well, always gay; but now I am seventy-nine years of age, and a beggar, and my heart begins to fail me.â\nStill he was not a regular mendicant: it was not until recently that want had driven him to this degradation; and he gave a touching picture of the struggle between hunger and pride, when abject destitution first came upon him. He was returning from Malaga without money; he had not tasted food for some time, and was crossing one of the great plains of Spain, where there were but few habitations. When almost dead with hunger, he applied at the door of a venta or country inn. âPerdon usted por Dios, hermano!â (âExcuse us, brother, for Godâs sake!â) was the reply â the usual mode in Spain of refusing a beggar.\nâI turned away,â said he, âwith shame greater than my hunger, for my heart was yet too proud. I came to a river with high banks, and deep, rapid current, and felt tempted to throw myself in: âWhat should such an old, worthless, wretched man as I live for?â But when I was on the brink of the current, I thought on the blessed Virgin, and turned away. I travelled on until I saw a country-seat at a little distance from the road, and entered the outer gate of the court-yard. The door was shut, but there were two young senoras at a window. I approached and begged. âPerdon usted por Dios, hermano!ââ and the window closed.\nâI crept out of the court-yard, but hunger overcame me, and my heart gave way: I thought my hour at hand, so I laid myself down at the gate, commended myself to the Holy Virgin, and covered my head to die. In a little while afterwards the master of the house came home. Seeing me lying at his gate, he uncovered my head, had pity on my gray hairs, took me into his house, and gave me food. So, senores, you see that one should always put confidence in the protection of the Virgin.â\nThe old man was on his way to his native place, Archidona, which was in full view on its steep and rugged mountain. He pointed to the ruins of its castle. âThat castle,â he said, âwas inhabited by a Moorish king at the time of the wars of Granada. Queen Isabella invaded it with a great army; but the king looked down from his castle among the clouds, and laughed her to scorn! Upon this the Virgin appeared to the queen, and guided her and her army up a mysterious path in the mountains, which had never before been known. When the Moor saw her coming, he was astonished, and springing with his horse from a precipice, was dashed to pieces! The marks of his horseâs hoofs,â said the old man, âare to be seen in the margin of the rock to this day. And see, senores, yonder is the road by which the queen and her army mounted: you see it like a ribbon up the mountainâs side; but the miracle is, that, though it can be seen at a distance, when you come near it disappears!â\nThe ideal road to which he pointed was undoubtedly a sandy ravine of the mountain, which looked narrow and defined at a distance, but became broad and indistinct on an approach.\nAs the old manâs heart warmed with wine and wassail, he went on to tell us a story of the buried treasure left under the castle by the Moorish king. His own house was next to the foundations of the castle. The curate and notary dreamed three times of the treasure, and went to work at the place pointed out in their dreams. His own son-in-law heard the sound of their pickaxes and spades at night. What they found nobody knows; they became suddenly rich, but kept their own secret. Thus the old man had once been next door to fortune, but was doomed never to get under the same roof.\nI have remarked that the stories of treasure buried by the Moors, so popular throughout Spain, are most current among the poorest people. Kind nature consoles with shadows for the lack of substantials. The thirsty man dreams of fountains and running streams, the hungry man of banquets, and the poor man of heaps of hidden gold: nothing certainly is more opulent than the imagination of a beggar.\nOur afternoonâs ride took us through a steep and rugged defile of the mountains, called Puerto del Rey, the Pass of the King; being one of the great passes into the territories of Granada, and the one by which King Ferdinand conducted his army. Towards sunset the road, winding round a hill, brought us in sight of the famous little frontier city of Loxa, which repulsed Ferdinand from its walls. Its Arabic name implies âguardian,â and such it was to the vega of Granada, being one of its advanced guards. It was the strong-hold of that fiery veteran, old Ali Atar, father-in-law of Boabdil; and here it was that the latter collected his troops, and sallied forth on that disastrous foray which ended in the death of the old alcayde and his own captivity. From its commanding position at the gate, as it were, of this mountain pass, Loxa has not unaptly been termed the key of Granada. It is wildly picturesque; built along the face of an arid mountain. The ruins of a Moorish alcazar or citadel crown a rocky mound which rises out of the centre of the town. The river Xenil washes its base, winding among rocks, and groves, and gardens, and meadows, and crossed by a Moorish bridge. Above the city all is savage and sterile, below is the richest vegetation and the freshest verdure. A similar contrast is presented by the river; above the bridge it is placid and grassy, reflecting groves and gardens; below it is rapid, noisy and tumultuous. The Sierra Nevada, the royal mountains of Granada, crowned with perpetual snow, form the distant boundary to this varied landscape; one of the most characteristic of romantic Spain.\nAlighting at the entrance of the city, we gave our horses to Sancho to lead them to the inn, while we strolled about to enjoy the singular beauty of the environs. As we crossed the bridge to a fine alameda, or public walk, the bells tolled the hour of oration. At the sound the wayfarers, whether on business or pleasure, paused, took off their hats, crossed themselves, and repeated their evening prayer â a pious custom still rigidly observed in retired parts of Spain. Altogether it was a solemn and beautiful evening scene, and we wandered on as the evening gradually closed, and the new moon began to glitter between the high elms of the alameda.\nWe were roused from this quiet state of enjoyment by the voice of our trusty squire hailing us from a distance. He came up to us, out of breath. âAh, senores,â cried he, âel pobre Sancho no es nada sin Don Quixote.â (âAh, senores, poor Sancho is nothing without Don Quixote.â) He had been alarmed at our not coming to the inn; Loxa was such a wild mountain place, full of contrabandistas, enchanters, and infiernos; he did not well know what might have happened, and set out to seek us, inquiring after us of every person he met, until he traced us across the bridge, and, to his great joy, caught sight of us strolling in the alameda.\nThe inn to which he conducted us was called the Corona, or Crown, and we found it quite in keeping with the character of the place, the inhabitants of which seem still to retain the bold, fiery spirit of the olden time. The hostess was a young and handsome Andalusian widow, whose trim basquina of black silk, fringed with bugles, set off the play of a graceful form and round pliant limbs. Her step was firm and elastic; her dark eye was full of fire, and the coquetry of her air, and varied ornaments of her person, showed that she was accustomed to be admired.\nShe was well matched by a brother, nearly about her own age; they were perfect models of the Andalusian majo and maja. He was tall, vigorous, and well-formed, with a clear olive complexion, a dark beaming eye, and curling chestnut whiskers that met under his chin. He was gallantly dressed in a short green velvet jacket, fitted to his shape, profusely decorated with silver buttons, with a white handkerchief in each pocket. He had breeches of the same, with rows of buttons from the hips to the knees; a pink silk handkerchief round his neck, gathered through a ring, on the bosom of a neatly-plaited shirt; a sash round the waist to match; bottinas, or spatterdashes, of the finest russet leather, elegantly worked, and open at the calf to show his stockings and russet shoes, setting off a well-shaped foot.\nAs he was standing at the door, a horseman rode up and entered into low and earnest conversation with him. He was dressed in a similar style, and almost with equal finery â a man about thirty, square-built, with strong Roman features, handsome, though slightly pitted with the small-pox; with a free, bold, and somewhat daring air. His powerful black horse was decorated with tassels and fanciful trappings, and a couple of broad-mouthed blunderbusses hung behind the saddle. He had the air of one of those contrabandistas I have seen in the mountains of Ronda, and evidently had a good understanding with the brother of mine hostess; nay, if I mistake not, he was a favored admirer of the widow. In fact, the whole inn and its inmates had something of a contrabandista aspect, and a blunderbuss stood in a corner beside the guitar. The horseman I have mentioned passed his evening in the posada, and sang several bold mountain romances with great spirit. As we were at supper, two poor Asturians put in in distress, begging food and a nightâs lodging. They had been waylaid by robbers as they came from a fair among the mountains, robbed of a horse, which carried all their stock in trade, stripped of their money, and most of their apparel, beaten for having offered resistance, and left almost naked in the road. My companion, with a prompt generosity natural to him, ordered them a supper and a bed, and gave them a sum of money to help them forward towards their home.\nAs the evening advanced, the dramatis personae thickened. A large man, about sixty years of age, of powerful frame, came strolling in, to gossip with mine hostess. He was dressed in the ordinary Andalusian costume, but had a huge sabre tucked under his arm, wore large moustaches, and had something of a lofty swaggering air. Every one seemed to regard him with great deference.\nOur man Sancho whispered to us that he was Don Ventura Rodriguez, the hero and champion of Loxa, famous for his prowess and the strength of his arm. In the time of the French invasion he surprised six troopers who were asleep: he first secured their horses, then attacked them with his sabre, killed some, and took the rest prisoners. For this exploit the king allows him a peseta (the fifth of a duro, or dollar) per day, and has dignified him with the title of Don.\nI was amused to behold his swelling language and demeanor. He was evidently a thorough Andalusian, boastful as brave. His sabre was always in his hand or under his arm. He carries it always about with him as a child does her doll, calls it his Santa Teresa, and says, âWhen I draw it, the earth tremblesâ (âtiembla la tierraâ).\nI sat until a late hour listening to the varied themes of this motley group, who mingled together with the unreserve of a Spanish posada. We had contrabandista songs, stories of robbers, guerilla exploits, and Moorish legends. The last were from our handsome landlady, who gave a poetical account of the infiernos, or infernal regions of Loxa, dark caverns, in which subterranean streams and waterfalls make a mysterious sound. The common people say that there are money-coiners shut up there from the time of the Moors, and that the Moorish kings kept their treasures in those caverns.\nI retired to bed with my imagination excited by all that I had seen and heard in this old warrior city. Scarce had I fallen asleep when I was aroused by a horrid din and uproar, that might have confounded the hero of La Mancha himself whose experience of Spanish inns was a continual uproar. It seemed for a moment as if the Moors were once more breaking into the town, or the infiernos of which mine hostess talked had broken loose. I sallied forth half dressed to reconnoiter. It was nothing more nor less than a charivari to celebrate the nuptials of an old man with a buxom damsel. Wishing him joy of his bride and his serenade, I returned to my more quiet bed, and slept soundly until morning.\nWhile dressing, I amused myself in reconnoitering the populace from my window. There were groups of fine-looking young men in the trim fanciful Andalusian costume, with brown cloaks, thrown about them in true Spanish style, which cannot be imitated, and little round majo hats stuck on with a peculiar knowing air. They had the same galliard look which I have remarked among the dandy mountaineers of Ronda. Indeed, all this part of Andalusia abounds with such game-looking characters. They loiter about the towns and villages, seem to have plenty of time and plenty of money: âhorse to ride and weapon to wear.â Great gossips; great smokers; apt at touching the guitar, singing couplets to their maja belles, and famous dancers of the bolero. Throughout all Spain the men, however poor, have a gentleman-like abundance of leisure, seeming to consider it the attribute of a true cavaliero never to be in a hurry; but the Andalusians are gay as well as leisurely, and have none of the squalid accompaniments of idleness. The adventurous contraband trade which prevails throughout these mountain regions, and along the maritime borders of Andalusia, is doubtless at the bottom of this galliard character.\nIn contrast to the costume of these groups was that of two long-legged Valencians conducting a donkey, laden with articles of merchandise, their musket slung crosswise over his back ready for action. They wore round jackets (jalecos), wide linen bragas or drawers scarce reaching to the knees and looking like kilts, red fajas or sashes swathed tightly round their waists, sandals of espartal or bass weed, colored kerchiefs round their heads somewhat in the style of turbans but leaving the top of the head uncovered; in short, their whole appearance having much of the traditional Moorish stamp.\nOn leaving Loxa we were joined by a cavalier, well mounted and well armed, and followed on foot by an escopetero or musketeer. He saluted us courteously, and soon let us into his quality. He was chief of the customs, or rather, I should suppose, chief of an armed company whose business it is to patrol the roads and look out for contrabandistas. The escopetero was one of his guards. In the course of our morningâs ride I drew from him some particulars concerning the smugglers, who have risen to be a kind of mongrel chivalry in Spain. They come into Andalusia, he said, from various parts, but especially from La Mancha, sometimes to receive goods, to be smuggled on an appointed night across the line at the plaza or strand of Gibraltar, sometimes to meet a vessel, which is to hover on a given night off a certain part of the coast. They keep together and travel in the night. In the daytime they lie quiet in barrancos, gullies of the mountains or lonely farm-houses; where they are generally well received, as they make the family liberal presents of their smuggled wares. Indeed, much of the finery and trinkets worn by the wives and daughters of the mountain hamlets and farm-houses are presents from the gay and open-handed contrabandistas.\nArrived at the part of the coast where a vessel is to meet them, they look out at night from some rocky point or headland. If they descry a sail near the shore they make a concerted signal; sometimes it consists in suddenly displaying a lantern three times from beneath the folds of a cloak. If the signal is answered, they descend to the shore and prepare for quick work. The vessel runs close in; all her boats are busy landing the smuggled goods, made up into snug packages for transportation on horseback. These are hastily thrown on the beach, as hastily gathered up and packed on the horses, and then the contrabandistas clatter off to the mountains. They travel by the roughest, wildest, and most solitary roads, where it is almost fruitless to pursue them. The custom-house guards do not attempt it: they take a different course. When they hear of one of these bands returning full freighted through the mountains, they go out in force, sometimes twelve infantry and eight horsemen, and take their station where the mountain defile opens into the plain. The infantry, who lie in ambush some distance within the defile, suffer the band to pass, then rise and fire upon them. The contrabandistas dash forward, but are met in front by the horsemen. A wild skirmish ensues. The contrabandistas, if hard pressed, become desperate. Some dismount, use their horses as breast-works, and fire over their backs; others cut the cords, let the packs fall off to delay the enemy, and endeavor to escape with their steeds. Some get off in this way with the loss of their packages; some are taken, horses, packages, and all; others abandon every thing, and make their escape by scrambling up the mountains. âAnd then,â cried Sancho, who had been listening with a greedy ear, âse hacen ladrones legitimosââ and then they become legitimate robbers.\nI could not help laughing at Sanchoâs idea of a legitimate calling of the kind; but the chief of customs told me it was really the case that the smugglers, when thus reduced to extremity, thought they had a kind of right to take the road, and lay travellers under contribution, until they had collected funds enough to mount and equip themselves in contrabandista style.\nTowards noon our wayfaring companion took leave of us and turned up a steep defile, followed by his escopetero; and shortly afterwards we emerged from the mountains, and entered upon the far famed Vega of Granada.\nOur last mid-dayâs repast was taken under a grove of olive-trees on the border of a rivulet. We were in a classical neighborhood; for not far off were the groves and orchards of the Soto de Roma. This, according to fabulous tradition, was a retreat founded by Count Julian to console his daughter Florinda. It was a rural resort of the Moorish kings of Granada, and has in modern times been granted to the Duke of Wellington.\nOur worthy squire made a half melancholy face as he drew forth, for the last time, the contents of his alforjas, lamenting that our expedition was drawing to a close, for, with such cavaliers, he said, he could travel to the worldâs end. Our repast, however, was a gay one; made under such delightful auspices. The day was without a cloud. The heat of the sun was tempered by cool breezes from the mountains. Before us extended the glorious Vega. In the distance was romantic Granada surmounted by the ruddy towers of the Alhambra, while far above it the snowy summits of the Sierra Nevada shone like silver.\nOur repast finished, we spread our cloaks and took our last siesta al fresco, lulled by the humming of bees among the flowers and the notes of doves among the olive-trees. When the sultry hours were passed we resumed our journey. After a time we overtook a pursy little man, shaped not unlike a toad and mounted on a mule. He fell into conversation with Sancho, and finding we were strangers, undertook to guide us to a good posada. He was an escribano (notary), he said, and knew the city as thoroughly as his own pocket. âAh Dios, senores! what a city you are going to see. Such streets! such squares! such palaces! and then the women â ah Santa Maria purisima â what women!â âBut the posada you talk of,â said I; âare you sure it is a good one?â\nâGood! Santa Maria! the best in Granada. Salones grandes â camas de luxo â colchones de pluma (grand saloons â luxurious sleeping rooms â beds of down). Ah, senores, you will fare like King Chico in the Alhambra.â\nâAnd how will my horses fare?â cried Sancho.\nâLike King Chicoâs horses. Chocolate con leche y bollos para almuerzaâ (âchocolate and milk with sugar cakes for breakfastâ), giving the squire a knowing wink and a leer.\nAfter such satisfactory accounts nothing more was to be desired on that head. So we rode quietly on, the squab little notary taking the lead, and turning to us every moment with some fresh exclamation about the grandeurs of Granada and the famous times we were to have at the posada.\nThus escorted, we passed between hedges of aloes and Indian figs, and through that wilderness of gardens with which the Vega is embroidered, and arrived about sunset at the gates of the city. Our officious little conductor conveyed us up one street and down another, until he rode into the courtyard of an inn where he appeared to be perfectly at home. Summoning the landlord by his Christian name, he committed us to his care as two caballeros de mucho valor, worthy of his best apartments and most sumptuous fare. We were instantly reminded of the patronizing stranger who introduced Gil Blas with such a flourish of trumpets to the host and hostess of the inn at Pennaflor, ordering trouts for his supper, and eating voraciously at his expense. âYou know not what you possess,â cried he to the innkeeper and his wife. âYou have a treasure in your house. Behold in this young gentleman the eighth wonder of the world â nothing in this house is too good for Senor Gil Blas of Santillane, who deserves to be entertained like a prince.â\nDetermined that the little notary should not eat trouts at our expense, like his prototype of Pennaflor, we forbore to ask him to supper; nor had we reason to reproach ourselves with ingratitude; for we found before morning the little varlet, who was no doubt a good friend of the landlord, had decoyed us into one of the shabbiest posadas in Granada.",

          "lyrics":"Arcade Fire | Everything Now\nReleased: July 28, 2017\nGenre: Alternative, Alternative Rock, Rock, Indie, Indie Rock, Canadian, Disco\nListening Format: iTunes\nHow did I find out about this album?\nI got home from work at about 12:30-1am, and was looking on kingdom leaks before I headed to bed. I saw it was released.  I went over to the albums page on Genius to see if it was transcribed yet, and the only song's that were available were the singles.  By 3:30, the album had been fully transcribed on the website, and I was ready to sleep.Opening statements | What did I think of the album\nI think that overall, the album was well done. Nice variety of instruments, and included a very nostalgic feel, while also maintaining a modern music style.  As mentioned in Kevin Loo's article on the site, \"The strong disco and pop-rock elements\" definitely makes Everything Now stand out from the rest of their albums. I never listened to Arcade Fire until the album was leaked.  Even at that, I figured I would help out the website by adding the lyrics and move on.  However, after listening to the album once to get the gist of the lyrics, I found myself wanting to listen again with an open mind, without any distractions.  This second listen was very different from my first play though. I found myself enjoying the songs more when my mind wasn't focused on what the artist was saying, I could listen to the instruments, and the meaning of the songs.How many times have I listened to this album?\n 3 times. Once to transcribe, twice to enjoy the album.  I listened to individual tracks throughout the day, driving around town, etc. As I write this review, I am listening to the album on my iPhone, so the count has probably gone up when this review is finished.Track One: Everything_Now (continued)\nRuntime: 0:46\nRating: 1/10\nThis song is the intro to the albums title track.  This song was originally released as the intro to \"Everything Now\" on the music video, however it is used as its own track on the albums released.  This song, while short, is very vital to the album.  The song begins, where the final track, Everything Now (continued), ends off to create an infinity loop on the album.  This style is very unique, I know of a few albums who have done this effect, and when done properly, can sound very seamless. An example of the \"infinity loop\" is found on Crywolf's albums, and I find myself enjoying the album even more, because I don't have to start it over. On his albums, the technique is used from song to song, but is still done seamlessly. There isn't much to say about this track, because it's short runtime.Track Two: Everything Now\nRuntime: 5:03\nRating: 3/10\nFavourite line: Every inch of sky's got a star / Every inch of skin's got a scar.\nThis song is very high energy. It kicks off the album with high energy, a catchy piano that can be heard throughout the song. I'll admit this song took me a few listens to \"enjoy\" it. When I first heard the song, it was very odd. I thought it was catchy, and very different style, with the back up singers constantly chanting \"Everything now!\" along with a very tropical feeling.  When I listened to this track, I felt that I was in a tropical place, or that this song would be used in a destination video, wandering through New York City, or even a movie like Madagascar as it just has that feel to it. I am from Canada, so really anyplace that isn't cold is very tropical. Since my first listen, it has gained on me.  It is not my favourite track on the album by any means, but it's not horrible.Track Three: Signs of Life\nRuntime: 4:37\nRating: 7/10\nFavourite line: Spend your life waiting in line / You find it hard to define / But you do it\nThis song is a very upbeat vibe to it, and acted as the second single for the album. The song's message is simple, we are all looking for something to fill a void. Whether it is some people who fill that void with partying, sex, faulty relationships, or maybe they will fill the void with another relationship that will be better. We all have something we fill the void with, while looking for that \"sign of life\" and when we don't find it, we fall back into the materialistic items. I think that this song was a very nostalgic feel, while including a disco melody, it caught my attention on the first listen. This song has to be one of my favourite songs of the album. Not to mention, the track is also produced by Thomas Bangalter, one of the two part duo Daft Punk.  Just by listening to the track, you can hear the Daft Punk style stand out in the track while also including Arcade Fire's own twist to the track. This song definitely stood out for me.Track Four: Creature Comfort\nRuntime: 4:44\nRating: 3/10\nFavourite line: Saying God, make me famous / If You can't, just make it painless\nWhile the message is great, the vocals on this track I found were terrible.  I didn't find the lyrics to rhyme, or anything to make the song a notable song.  The message is about people who fall into the trap of materialistic things, and are constantly feeling they need to change something about themselves to impress others. Win uses this song as a bold approach, to talk about the issues in our society. More specifically, the issues that millennials and after are facing. This includes the increasing amount of teens who struggle with anorexia, as well as (if I dare say) as a narcissistic society. This means, our ever-growing attachment to our cell phones, what others think about us, as well as if our \"selfies\" look flawless or not. It isn't specified to one gender either.  Typically, when you look at those issues that people face mentioned above, the first gender you will probably think of is female.  Be honest, that was the first.  It's okay, however, male's feel insecure and take selfies as well.  We men face the same issues there, it may not be as common, but it definitely is there.Stand in the mirror and wait for the feedback\nSome boys get too much, too much love, too much touch\nSome boys starve themselves\nStand in the mirror and wait for the feedback\n\nIf you look at the song for its message, it's a beautiful song.  However, listening to the track, something just doesn't add up.  To me, the best way to describe it is almost like a whiney, annoyed kind of singing, while also (in my opinion) not sounding the best.  I am not saying that Win isn't a great singer, because I truly believe that his voice is great, on this track, not his style.Track Five: Peter Pan\nRuntime: 2:49\nRating: 9/10\nFavourite line: Be my Wendy, I'll be your Peter Pan\nAnnotations: first | second | song bio\n \"Peter Pan\" is one of my favourite tracks on the album.  I love the reference that the group made to the classic book, which was later turned into a movie.  One of the annotations {second} that I made for the track talks about the line found in the chorus.We can live, I don't feel like dying\n\nI love this line, as it is so clever. While it seems very self explanatory, it goes more in depth when talking about the Peter Pan story. If you haven't checked out the tate, basically I explained that Peter is a boy who can fly and never grows up.  He falls in love with this girl named Wendy, and brings her and her siblings to Never Land, where Peter wishes they can live forever together on this island.  This talks to anyone who is in a relationship.  When you really love someone, you give them your heart, and devote yourself to them hopefully for the rest of your life.  I think that talks when we live with that person for our life, we don't want to die because you really do love them. This line is very similar, only Peter really can live forever.\nThis song, while short, has a great catchy beat, that will draw you in first listen. Plus, it puts you in a happy state of mind, before listening to the following (slightly disturbing) track.Track Six: Chemistry\nRuntime: 3:38\nRating: 6.5/10\nFavourite line: Ask for a dance with another boy / My heart's a city, you're out to destroy / Chemistry\nAnnotations: song bio\nThis song takes the old saying \"we've got chemistry\" to a whole new level.  While being a very clever song, and also well done audibly, it has a very dark and sinister undertone found when looking at the lyrics. The song starts off talking about a guy at a bar, who is attracted to a girl who shows no interest in him.  This girl starts to create excuses to not be with this guy (i.e: dance with your boyfriend all night long | Call your mother, make an excuse) and he won't give it up because there is \"chemistry\" whether you want to deny it or not.  While it may seem sorta romantic that he won't give up and that there is this \"chemistry\", the male character won't give up or \"take the hint\" so to speak.\nWhen I looked back at the lyrics I had typed up, I felt very eerie about the song.  It has a very disco feel and upbeat vibe, but the lyrics are very dark and stalker-ish.  I feel that Arcade Fire was able to pull this off, but if you were quoting the lyrics or stating the lyrics in public, people will take it the wrong way.  It doesn't read as romantic and fantasized as it does when listening to the track.\nI appreciate the style that they took on this track. I honestly do.  Taking the old quote of \"chemistry\" to a whole new style is very unique. Although, this track isn't my favourite track, it isn't horrible.  It is a very twisted love song, especially after listening to Peter Pan.Track Seven & Eight: Infinite Content & Infinite_Content\nRuntime: 1:37 | 1:42\nRating: 0/10\nI HATED these two songs. I felt that they were both very unnecessary, and didn't have any structure. I don't even have a way to describe it. It didn't fit their style, it was out of nowhere, as well as repeated \"Infinite Content\" over and over.  I understand their message.\nThe album includes the theme of social media, and the impact that it has on our life.  As mentioned in Kevin Loo's article on the site, \"...he reflects on peopleâs desire for consumption. This theme is also prominent on âInfinite Content.\" Between never-ending social media feeds and constantly updating news, the repeated lyrics emphasize an obsession with digital content. Butlerâs play-on-words only serves to highlight humanityâs deep dissatisfaction with modern life.\"\n\nThe ONLY positive thing that I have about these two songs, it includes the \"Infinity Loop\" talked about on \"Everything Now\" and it is hard to tell that you switched songs.  I mean, listening to the song, you can tell because it goes from high energy, to acoustic.  The lyrics don't change, but the style does.  Truthfully, the band could have merged the two tracks together, and it would have sounded the exact same.Track Nine: Electric Blue\nRuntime: 4:02\nRating: 7/10\nFavourite line: Now you've got me so confused / 'Cause I don't know how to sing your blues\n\"Electric Blue\" is very different compared to the other songs on Everything Now.  I mentioned before how some parts of the songs are sung by back up female vocalists, well \"Electric Blue\" is only the female vocalists. From what I can hear, Win doesn't actually sing in this song. It is all the back up singers.  I like this idea, as I feel it acts as an interlude or transition to the second half of the album.\nThis song seems to be a heavily inspired David Bowie track. It is unique, and breaks all kinds of rules that are set in place for artists when creating music. Like David Bowie's music, it doesn't matter, it is art and you like it or don't. Fans have speculated that the track is a tribute to Bowie as he helped out on their track \"Reflecktor\" and the term \"electric blue\" can be looked at as something that \"helped influence David Bowie's career\" as pointed out on the song's bio.\nOn a sidenote, I found that this song sounds very similar to one of my favourites bands MUTEMATH.  More noticeably on their newest album Vitals and new track's \"Hit Parade\" or \"Stroll On\", both Arcade Fire and MUTEMATH have seemed to get this style down pat. If you listen to some of MUTEMATH's work, you can notice that the heavily used electric guitar and almost disco sound is constant with both bands.  It feels very nostalgic, and also as if you are listening to music from a utopian society. It's very unique, and if it's done right, can sound beautiful.\nI'll admit, it took me a few listens to start to enjoy this track. It is not my favourite on the album, but it is not horrible.  It gets a solid 7 because I enjoy the style of the track, as well as the message it gives.Track Ten: Good God Damn\nRuntime: 3:34\nRating: 9/10\nFavourite line: Maybe there's a good God / If He made you\nAnnotations: first (co-sign) | song bio (co-sign)\n\"Good God Damn\" has to be another one of my favourite tracks on Everything Now.  The song is very deep and heavy, it deals with the suicidal thoughts of a girl who is also a big fan of Arcade Fire (as fans speculate her story is introduced on Creature Comfort.  After attempting to end her life, she has an epiphany where she wonders what if there is a Good God who is looking out for her, and backs out of ending her life.\nWhile this song is heavy, being as it was released shortly after the death of Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, it shares a message of hope.  I am a Christian, so I believe that there is a reason for this pain or dark time that you or I might be going through and it will get better. Now, some people don't think the same way as me, which is totally okay! I don't hate you or anything like that.  This song just speaks to me as it shows someone who turns to religion in times that are tough, rather than giving into the temptation or evil thoughts of suicide.Track Eleven: Put Your Money On Me\nRuntime: 5:53\nRating: 10/10\nFavourite line: If there was a race, a race for your heart / It started before you were born | We were born innocent, but it lasts a day\n\"Put Your Money On Me\" is my favourite song on this album. When I first heard the track, it was an instant favourite.  I love the style that they take, with back up vocals returning on the track, but behind Win.  This song has a very nostalgic feel, with some fans sensing a heavy inspiration from ABBA.\nI really enjoy every part of this song.  The message is about a man, who really wants his woman to trust him.  \"Money\" is a sign of wealth and power, as pointed out in popular novel \"The Great Gatsby\" where the characters and side characters all get distracted by money.  This song reminds me of Gatsby for a few reasons. In the novel, Gatsby uses his money to prove he is worth it, and also tries to lure Daisy into falling in love with him. This man tries to get his girl to show the money that she has and bet that he is worth it.Track Twelve: We Don't Deserve Love\nRuntime: 6:29\nRating: 8/10\nFavourite line: When we met, you'd never expect this / And you said, maybe we don't deserve love\nFirst of all, this song was very hard to transcribe. Before the album was released, there was a lot of question marks left on the page.  Since then, official lyrics have been added and the message is a little easier to understand.  This song deals with loss of a loved one, and even regret.  Listening to this song, I start to understand the feelings that Win must have felt while writing this song.  Heartbreak, and even curiosity powers this song and drives it's message out of the park.  I love the animated feeling that Win has, he sounds very passionate about the subject.  I wonder if he had these emotions happen recently, or knows of someone who has and wrote it inspired by them.  It's not a love song, its a message for those who have lost a loved one and are looking to move forward in life.Track Thirteen: Everything Now (continued)\nRuntime: 2:22\nRating: 2/10\nFavourite line: We'll make it home again\nThis is the final track on Everything Now and acts as the first half of the infinity loop.  Where this song ends, the first song picks up.  There isn't much to comment on, as it has been stated for \"Everything Now\" and \"Everything_Now (continued)\" plus the lyrics are very minimal.FINAL THOUGHTS\nI enjoyed this album. With a very unique style, it will definitely be an album I can throw on while studying and not be distracted, but also not be bored. Another band that I will indulge into their music, and discover more styles unique to their name.Will I listen again? | Yes, more than once\nWill I suggest to a friend? | Depends on their music style, if they enjoy rock or alternative, definitely.\nWill I add this album to my vinyl collection? | If I can find it at a reasonable price, probably. It also will help to have it here in Canada, in stores. That will play into account as well.\nWell, if you have read this by your own will, lucky me! If you stumbled on my account by accident, again lucky me! I look forward to writing another review next week.  I plan to write a review every weekend.\nALL THE LYRICS FOR EVERYTHING NOW ARE AVAILABLE NOW.\nNEXT PROJECT REVIEW: Andy Mineo and Wordsplayed Present Magic & Bird",

Perhaps if I\nexplain things, he'll rest easy...\nDUKE\n(roaring over the\nroad noise)\nTHERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD\nPROBABLY UNDERSTAND --\nThe HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.\nDUKE\n(yells)\nCAN YOU HEAR ME?\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs\ninto the back seat.\nDUKE\nThat's good.  Because I want you to\nhave all the background.  This is a\nvery ominous assignment -- with\novertones of extreme personal\ndanger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism!\nThis is important, goddamnit!  This\nis a true story!...\n(WHACKS the BACK OF\nTHE DRIVER'S SEAT\nwith his fist)\n\nThe CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.\nGONZO\n(screams)\nKeep your hands off my fucking neck!\nThe HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS\nHIM BACK DOWN.\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur vibrations were getting nasty --\nbut why?  Was there no communication\nin this car?  Had we deteriorated\nto the level of dumb beasts?\nThe HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.\n7.\n\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nI want you to understand that this\nman at the wheel is my attorney!\nHe's not just some dingbat I found\non the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I\nthink he's probably Samoan.  But it\ndoesn't matter, does it?  Are you\nprejudiced?\nHITCHHIKER\nHell, no!\nDUKE\nI didn't think so.  Because in\nspite of his race, this man is\nextremely valuable to me.  Hell, I\nforgot all about this beer.  You\nwant one?\n(HITCHHIKER shakes\nhis head)\nHow about some ether?\nHITCHHIKER\nWhat?\nDUKE\nNever mind.  Let's get right to the\nheart of this thing.  Twenty-four\nhours ago we were sitting in the\nPogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills\nHotel...\nINT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY\nA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE\nthrough the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They\nare the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL\nBOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore\nSlings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED\nVERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.\nDUKE (V/O)\n... in the patio section, of\ncourse, drinking Singapore Slings\nwith mescal on the side, hiding\nfrom the brutish realities of this\nfoul year of Our Lord, 1971.\nThe DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and\nshades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank\ntop undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious\nconversation.\n8.\n\nDUKE\nI'm telling you, the Salazar story\nis getting too complicated.  The\nweasels have started closing in.\nThe DWARF sneers.\nDWARF\nPerhaps this is the call you've\nbeen waiting for all this time,\nsir...\nDUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...\nDUKE\nUh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh...\nDUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A\nMOVIE SPY.\nDWARF\nThat was headquarters.  They want\nme to go to Las Vegas at once and\nmake contact with a Portuguese\nphotographer named Lacerda.  He'll\nhave the details.  All I have to do\nis check into my sound proof suite\nand he'll seek me out.\nGONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!\nGONZO\nGod hell!  I think I see the\npattern!  This one sounds like real\ntrouble!  You're going to need\nplenty of legal advice before this\nthing is over.  As your attorney I\nmust advise you that you'll need a\nvery fast car with no top and after\nthat, the cocaine.  And then the\ntape recorder, for special music,\nand some Acapulco shirts...\n(GONZO tucks his\nkhaki undershirt into\nhis white\nbellbottoms -- he\nmeans business!)\nThis blows my weekend, because\nnaturally I'll have to go with\nyou -- and we'll have to arm\nourselves.\n9.\n\nDUKE\nWhy not?  If a thing's worth doing,\nit's worth doing right.\nDUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them\nwith the (very large) check in his hand.\nThey sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it\nswinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.\nDUKE\nI tell you, my man.  This is the\nAmerican Dream in action!  We'd be\nfools not to ride this strange\ntorpedo all the way to the end.\nGONZO\nIndeed.  We must do it.  What kind\nof story is this?\nEXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY\nDUKE and GONZO emerge.\nDUKE\nThe Mint 400!  The richest off-road\nrace for motorcycles and dune-\nbuggies in the history of organized\nsport!\n(handing parking\nticket to Valet)\n-- a fantastic spectacle in honor\nof some fatback grossero who owns\nthe luxurious Mint Hotel in the\nheart of downtown Vegas... at least\nthat's what the press release says.\nTheir car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They\njump in.\nDUKE\nWe're going to have to drum it up\non our own.  Pure Gonzo Journalism.\nAnd they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-\nbleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY\nThe PINTO races through shot.\nDUKE (V/O)\nGetting hold of the drugs and\nshirts had been no problem...\n10.\n\nEXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\nThe PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back\nwindow full of Hawaiian shirts.\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\n... but the car and tape recorder\nwere not easy things to round up at\n6:30 on a Friday afternoon in\nHollywood.\nINT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY\nTORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile\nas GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four\nSingapore Slings.\nGONZO\nO.K., O.K., yes.  Hang onto it.\nWe'll be there in thirty minutes.\n(to DUKE -- hand over\nthe PHONE)\nI finally located a car with\nadequate horsepower and the proper\ncoloring.\n(into PHONE)\nWhat?!  OF COURSE the gentleman has\na major credit card!  Do you\nrealize who the fuck you're talking\nto?\nDUKE\nDon't take any guff from these\nswine.\n(GONZO slams the\nphone down)\nNow we need a sound store with the\nfinest equipment.  Nothing dinky.\nOne of those new Belgian Heliowatts\nwith a voice-activated shotgun\nmike, for picking up conversations\nin oncoming cars.\nGONZO\nWe won't make the nut unless we\nhave unlimited credit.\nDUKE\nWe will.  You Samoans are all the\nsame.  You have no faith in the\nessential decency of the white\nman's culture.\n11.\n\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK\nThe PINTO races down street.\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe store was closed, but the\nsalesman said he would wait, if we\nhurried...\nEXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK\nThey're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE\nBANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut we were delayed en route when a\nStingray in front of us killed a\npedestrain.\nDirectly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered\ncorpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.\nEXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had trouble, again, at the car\nrental agency.\nBehind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with\nsatisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out\na clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.\nAGENT\nSay... uh... you fellas are going\nto be careful with this car, aren't\nyou?\nDUKE\nOf course.\nDUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the\ngas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.\nAGENT\nWell, good god!  You just backed\nover that two foot concrete abutment\nand you didn't even slow down!\nForty-five in reverse!  And you\nbarely missed the pump!\nDUKE\nNo harm done.  I always test the\ntransmission that way.  The rear\nend.  For stress factors.\n12.\n\nGONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box\nof rum and ice into the RED SHARK.\nAGENT\nSay.  Are you fellows drinking?\nDUKE\nNot me.  We're responsible people.\nHe JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The\nAGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.\nGONZO\nThere's another worrier.  He's\nprobably all cranked up on speed.\nEXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT\nSTRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted\nfigures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe spent the rest of that night\nrounding up materials and packing\nthe car.  Then we ate some mescaline\nand went swimming.\nThe surf crashes in the distance...\nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT\nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself\nfloat up through the silvery bubbles...\nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING\nMOONLIT SURF.\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur trip was different.  It was to\nbe a classic affirmation of\neverything right and true in the\nnational character; a gross,\nphysical salute to the fantastic\npossibilities of life in this\ncountry.  But only for those with\ntrue grit...\nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\nDUKE's intense face.\nDUKE\n...and we're chock full of that!\n13.\n\nGONZO\nDamn right!\nDUKE\nMy attorney understands this\nconcept, despite his racial handicap.\nBut do you?!\nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.\nDUKE (V/O)\nHe said he understood, but I could\nsee in his eyes that he didn't.  He\nwas lying to me.\nGONZO\nMy heart!\nGONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and\nscreeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nWhere's the medicine?\nDUKE\nThe medicine?  Yes, it's right here.\nDUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.\nDUKE\nDon't worry, this man has a bad\nheart... Angina Pectoris.  But we\nhave a cure for it.\nDUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO\nfalls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The\nHITCHHIKER looks petrified.\nGONZO\n(suddenly flailing\nhis naked arms at the sky)\nTurn up the fucking music!  My\nheart feels like an alligator!\nVolume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must\nhave bass!  What's wrong with us?\nAre you goddamn old ladies?\nDUKE\n(turns up music to\nfull volume)\nYou scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch\nyour language!

We need\nhelp!\nDUKE\n(to HITCHHIKER)\nPay no attention to this swine.  He\ncan't handle the medicine.\n(he begins laughing)\n\nGONZO\n(to the HITCHHIKER)\nThe truth is we're going to Vegas\nto croak a scag baron named Savage\nHenry.  I've known him for years\nbut he ripped us off -- and you\nknow what that means, right?\nGONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.\nGONZO (CONT'D)\nSavage Henry has cashed his check!\nWe're going to rip his lungs out!\nDUKE\nAnd eat them!  That bastard won't\nget away with this!  What's going\non in this country when a scum\nsucker like that can get away with\nsandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?\nGONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.\nThe HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,\nAND FLEES.\nHITCHHIKER\nThanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot.\nI like you guys.  Don't worry about\nme.\nDUKE\n(yells)\nWait a minute!  Come back and have\na beer!\nThe HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.\n15.\n\nGONZO\nGood riddance.  That boy made me\nnervous.  Did you see his eyes?\n(laughing)\nJesus, this is good medicine.\nDUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.\nDUKE\n(suddenly clambering\ninto the front seat)\nMove over!!  We have to get out of\nCalifornia before that kid finds a\ncop!\nDUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...\nEXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY\nTHE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead\ndriving.\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was absolutely imperative that\nwe get to the Mint Hotel before the\ndeadline for press registration.\nOtherwise, we might have to pay for\nour suite.\nGONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off\nand the powder swirls away on the wind.\nGONZO\nOh, Jesus!  Did you see what god\njust did to us?\nDUKE\nGod didn't do that!  You did it!\nYou're a fucking narcotics agent,\nthat was our cocaine, you pig!\nGONZO\n(waving his .357\nMagnum at Duke)\nYou better be careful.  Plenty of\nvultures out here.  They'll pick\nyour bones clean before morning.\nDUKE\nYou whore!\nGONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.\n16.\n\nGONZO\nHere -- chew this.  It's your half\nof the acid.\nDUKE takes his half -- chews it.\nDUKE\nHow long do I have?\nGONZO\nMaybe thirty more minutes.  As your\nattorney, I advise you to drive at\ntop speed.  It'll be a goddamn\nmiracle if we can get there before\nyou turn into a wild animal.  Are\nyou ready for that?  Checking into\na Vegas hotel under a phony name\nwith intent to commit capital fraud\nand a head full of acid.\nDUKE (V/O)\nThirty minutes.  It was going to be\nvery close.\nThe RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:\n\"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \\ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20\nYEARS; SALE - LIFE!!\"\nEXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK\nThe RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner\nspanning the street announces the MINT 400.\nDUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a\nbuckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the\nTICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.\nDUKE\nI need this, right?\nATTENDANT\nI'll remember your face.\nDUKE stares -- losing it...\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere is no way of explaining the\nterror I felt.\nINT.

DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm\nintensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.\nGONZO\nI can handle this.  This man has a\nbad heart, but I have plenty of\nmedicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo.\nPrepare our suite at once.  We'll\nbe in the bar.\nGONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.

Duke struggles to\nkeep him in his line of vision.\nGONZO\nI just went upstairs to see this\nman Lacerda.  I told him I knew\nwhat he was up to...\n(GONZO rallies --\nturns fierce)\nHe says he's a photographer!  But\nwhen I mentioned Savage Henry he\nfreaked!

DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.\nDUKE\nMACE!  YOU WANT THIS?\nGONZO stops -- hisses.\nGONZO\nYou bastard!  You'd do that,\nwouldn't you?\n48.\n\nDUKE\n(laughs)\nWhy worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing\nin the world like a Mace high.\nForty-five minutes on your knees\nwith the dry heaves...\nGONZO\nYou cheap honky sonofabitch...\nDUKE\nWhy not?  Hell, just a minute ago,\nyou were asking me to kill you!\nAnd now you want to kill me!  What\nI should do, goddamnit, is call the\npolice!\nGONZO\nThe cops?\nDUKE\nThere's no choice.  I wouldn't dare\ngo to sleep with you wandering\naround with a head full of acid and\nwanting to slice me up with that\ngoddamn knife!\nGONZO\n(mumbles)\nWho said anything about slicing you\nup?  I just wanted to carve a\nlittle Z on your forehead.  Nothing\nserious.\nGONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.\nDUKE\n(menaces him with the MACE)\nGet back in that tub.  Eat some\nreds and try to calm down.  Smoke\nsome grass, shoot some smack --\nshit, do whatever you have to do,\nbut let me get some rest.\nGONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.\nGONZO\nHell, yes.  You really need some\nsleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn.\nWhat a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't\nlet me keep you up.\n49.\n\nGONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair\nup against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next\nto the clock.\nDUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He\ncollapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.\nDUKE (V/O)\nIgnore the nightmare in the bathroom.\nJust another ugly refugee from the\nLove Generation.\nThe WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his\nface.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL\nBEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney had never been able to\naccept the notion -- often espoused\nby former drug abusers -- that you\ncan get a lot higher without drugs\nthan with them.  And neither have\nI, for that matter.\nThe pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL\nLIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the\nforeground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior\nof A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.\nINT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT\nA slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the\naction is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.\nDUKE (V/O)\nI recall one night in the Matrix.\nThere I was -- a victim of the Drug\nExplosion.  A natural street freak,\njust eating whatever came by.\nA ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The\nsound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.\nROAD-PERSON\nAnybody want some L...S...D...?  I\ngot all the makin's right here.\nAll I need is a place to cook.\nThe camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.\nINT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT\nStill in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a\nHUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.\n50.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI decided to eat only half at first.\nGood thinking.  But I spilled the\nrest on the sleeve of my red\nPendleton shirt.\nDUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the\ndoor to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in\nslow-motion.\nMUSICIAN\nWhat's the trouble?\nDUKE\n(also in slow-motion)\nWell, all this white stuff on my\nsleeve is LSD.\nThe MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A\nlong pause.\nCut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-\ncut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.\nWe cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the\nmen's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...\nsucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The\nSTOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.\nDUKE (V/O)\nWith a bit of luck his life was\nruined -- forever thinking that\njust behind some narrow door in all\nhis favorite bars, men in red\nPendleton shirts are getting\nincredible kicks from things he'll\nnever know.\nINT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT\nThe STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking\nlost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a\nTV white noise snowstorm.\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\nDUKE sits staring at the TV.\n51.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nStrange memories on this nervous\nnight in Las Vegas.\n(he gets up, pours\nhimself a drink)\nHas it been five years?  Six?  It\nseems like a lifetime -- the kind\nof peak that never comes again.\nSan Francisco in the middle sixties\nwas a very special time and place\nto be a part of.  But no\nexplanation, no mix of words or\nmusic or memories can touch that\nsense of knowing that you were\nthere and alive in that corner of\ntime and the world.  Whatever it\nmeant.\nDUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.\nEXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE\nWe are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.\nDUKE (V/O)\nTHERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION,\nAT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE\nSPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A\nFANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT\nWHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT,\nTHAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I\nTHINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE\nOF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE\nFORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY\nMEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T\nNEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY\nprevail.  We had all the momentum;\nwe were riding the crest of a high\nand beautiful wave...\nDUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE\nNEVER SEEN BEFORE.\nDUKE (V/O)\nSo now, less than five years later,\nyou can go up on a steep hill in\nLas Vegas and look west, and with\nthe right kind of eyes you can\nalmost see the high water mark --\nthat place where the wave finally\nbroke and rolled back.\n52.\n\nThe memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.\nSuddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi\nshouting \"WOODSTOCK ÃBER ALLES!\"\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\nDUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.\nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN\nA harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking\nlike shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe decision to flee came suddenly.\nOr maybe not.\nDUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of\nfruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.\nBELL BOY\nRoom service!\nThe BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already\nstacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.\nDUKE (V/O)\nMaybe I'd planned it all along --\nsubconsciously waiting for the\nright moment.  The bill was a\nfactor, I think.  Because I had no\nmoney to pay for it.\nDUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.\nDUKE (V/O)\nOur room service tabs had been\nrunning somewhere between $29 and\n$36 per hour, for forty-eight\nconsecutive hours.  Incredible.\nHow could it happen?\nDUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED\nLUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --\nempty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut by the time I asked this\nquestion, there was no one around\nto answer.\nDUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.\n53.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy attorney was gone.  He must have\nsensed trouble.\nQUICK CUT TO:\nEXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY\nGONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of\nbrand-new fine cowhide luggage.\nDUKE (V/O)\nPanic.\nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY\nDUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --\nleaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both\nways, then hurries away down the corridor.\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt crept up my spine like first\nrising vibes of an acid frenzy.\nAll these horrible realities began\nto dawn on me.\nINT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY\nAn anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the\nelevator descends.  He searches his pockets...\nDUKE (V/O)\nHere I was, alone in Las Vegas,\nwith this goddamned incredibly\nexpensive car, completely twisted\non drugs, no cash, no story for the\nmagazine.  And on top of everything\nelse I had a gigantic goddamn hotel\nbill to deal with.\nDUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.\nThe door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN\nHANDCUFFS.\nDUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors\nclose.\nDUKE (V/O)\nI didn't even know who had won the\nrace.  Maybe nobody.\n54.\n\nINT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY\nDUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering\nMANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.\nDUKE\n(muttering to himself)\nHow would Horatio Alger have\nhandled this situation?\nEXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY\nMotoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN\nwith a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves\nat the CAR BOY.\nDUKE (V/O)\nStay calm.  Stay calm.  I'm a\nrelatively respectable citizen -- a\nmultiple felon, perhaps, but\ncertainly not dangerous.\nThe CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The\nback seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint\n400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.\nDUKE (V/O CONT'D)\nLuckily, I had taken the soap and\ngrapefruit and other luggage out to\nthe car a few hours earlier.  Now\nit was only a matter of slipping\nthe noose...\nDUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMR. DUKE!\nDUKE freezes.\nCLERK'S VOICE\nMr. Duke!  We've been looking for\nyou!\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe game was up!  They had me.\nDUKE\n(to himself)\nWell, why not?  Many fine books\nhave been written in prison.\n55.\n\nResigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK\narrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS\nHAND.\nCLERK\nSir?\n(thrusts out a TELEGRAM)\nThis telegram came for you.\nActually, it isn't for you.  It's\nfor somebody named Thompson, but it\nsays 'care of Raoul Duke'.  does\nthat make sense?\nDUKE\n(barely able to speak)\nYes... It makes sense.\nDUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.\nThe CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous\nstash inside.\nCLERK\nI checked the register for this man\nThompson.  We don't show him but I\nfigured he might be part of your\nteam.\nDUKE\nHe is.  Don't worry, I'll get it to\nhim.\nHe fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.\nSECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word\nor two.\nCLERK\nWhat confused us was Dr. Gonzo's\nsignature on the telegram from Los\nAngeles.  When we knew he was right\nhere in the hotel.\nDUKE\nYou did the right thing.  Never try\nto understand a press message.\nAbout half the time we use codes --\nespecially with Dr. Gonzo.\nCLERK\nTell me.  When will the doctor be\nawake?\n56.\n\nDUKE\n(tenses)\nAwake?  What do you mean?\nDUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.\nCLERK\n(uncomfortably)\nWell... the manager, Mr. Heem,\nwould like to meet him.  Nothing\nunusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet\nall our large accounts... put them\non a personal basis... just a chat\nand a handshake, you understand.\nDUKE\nOf course.  But if I were you, I'd\nleave the Doctor alone until after\nhe's eaten breakfast.  He's a very\ncrude man.\nDUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.\nCLERK\nBut he will be available?  Perhaps\nlater this morning?\nDUKE\nLook.  That telegram was all\nscrambled.  It was actually from\nThompson, not to him.  Western\nUnion must have gotten the names\nreversed.  I have to get going.  I\nhave to get out to the track.\nCLERK\nThere's no hurry!  The race is over!\nDUKE\n(taking off)\nNot for me.\nHe waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.\nCLERK\nLet's have lunch!\nDUKE\nRighto!\nEXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY\nDUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.\n57.\n\nA \"YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS\" sign flashes past.\nBob Dylan plays: \"Memphis Blues Again -- \"Aaww, Mama, can\nthis really by the end...?\"\nA sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.\nDUKE (V/O)\nJesus, bad waves of paranoia,\nmadness, fear and loathing --\nintolerable vibrations in this\nplace.  Get out!  The weasels were\nclosing in.  I could smell the ugly\nbrutes.  Flee!\nDUKE drives fast.\nDUKE\nDo me one last favor Lord: just\ngive me five more high-speed hours\nbefore you bring the hammer down;\njust let me get rid of this goddamn\ncar and off of this horrible desert.\nA sign flashes \"YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.\"\nA patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nYou evil bastard!  This is your\nwork!  You'd better take care of\nme, Lord... because if you don't\nyou're going to have me on your\nhands.\nThe patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.\nDUKE (V/O)\nFew people understand the psychology\nof dealing with a Highway Traffic\nCop.  Your normal speeder will\npanic and immediately pull over to\nthe side.  This is wrong.\nDUKE floors the gas pedal.\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt arouses contempt in the cop heart.\nTHE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.\n58.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMake the bastard chase you.  He\nwill follow.  But he won't know\nwhat to make of your blinker signal\nthat says you're about to turn right.\nDUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.\nDUKE (V/O)\nThis is to let him know you're\nlooking for a proper place to pull\noff and talk.\nAN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.\nDUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt will take him a moment to\nrealize that he is about to make\n180 degree turn at speed... but you\nwill be ready for it, braced for\nthe G's and the fast heel toe work.\nThe patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.\nEXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY\nThe patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE\nstands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nJust what the FUCK did you think\nyou were doing?!\nDUKE smiles.\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nMay I see your license.\nDUKE\nOf course, officer.\nDUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer\ncan -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.\nDUKE (V/O)\nI knew I was fucked.\nThe COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for\nDUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.\n59.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nCould I have that, please?\nDUKE\nWhy not?  It was getting warm anyway.\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --\nglances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars\nof soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou realize...\nDUKE\nYeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I\nunderstand that.  I knew it was a\ncrime but I did it anyway.  Shit,\nwhy argue?  I'm a fucking criminal.\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nThat's a strange attitude.\nHe looks at DUKE thoughtfully.\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nYou know -- I get the feeling you\ncould use a nap.  There's a rest\narea up ahead.  Why don't you pull\nover and sleep a few hours?\nDUKE\nA nap won't help.  I've been awake\nfor too long -- three or four\nnights.  I can't even remember.  If\nI go to sleep now, I'm dead for\ntwenty hours.\nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nOkay.  Here's how it is.  What goes\ninto my book, as of noon, is that I\napprehended you... for driving too\nfast, and advised you to proceed no\nfurther than the next rest area...\nyour stated destination, right?\nWhere you plan to take a long nap.\nDo I make myself clear?\nDUKE\nHow far is Baker?  I was hoping to\nstop there for lunch.\n60.\n\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nNot my jurisdiction.  The city\nlimits are two point two miles\nbeyond the rest area.  Can you make\nit that far?\nDUKE\nI'll try.  I've been wanting to go\nto Baker for a long time.  I've\nheard a lot about it.\nThe PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.\nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN\nExcellent seafood.  With a mind\nlike yours, you'll probably want to\ntry the land-crab.  Try the Majestic\nDiner.\nThe PATROLMAN slams the door shut.\nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY\nDUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt raped.  The Pig had done me\non all fronts, and now he was going\noff to chuckle about it -- on the\nwest side of town, waiting for me\nto make a run for L.A.\nDUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he\nsignals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn\nhe sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn\ntheir eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER\ndrops his thumb.\nDUKE\nGreat Jesus, it's him.\nDUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE\nWAY HE CAME.\nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\nDUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.\nDUKE\nThey've nailed me!  I'm trapped in\nsome stinking desert crossroads\ncalled Baker.  I don't have much\ntime.  The fuckers are closing in.\nThey'll hunt me down like a beast!\n61.\n\nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\nGONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.

GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY\nGONZO\nYou're supposed to be in Vegas.  We\nhave a suite at the Flamingo.  I\nwas just about to leave for the\nairport.\nINT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY\nDUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket.\nGONZO'S VOICE\nYou brainless scumbag!  You're\nsupposed to be covering the National\nDistrict Attorney's conference!  I\nmade all the reservations... rented\na white Cadillac convertible... the\nwhole thing is arranged!  What the\nhell are you doing out there in the\nmiddle of the fucking desert?\n62.\n\nDUKE stares at the telegram.\nDUKE\nNever mind.  It's all a big joke.\nI'm actually sitting beside the\npool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking\nfrom a portable phone.  Some dwarf\nbrought it out from the casino.  I\nhave total credit!  Can you grasp\nthat?\n(shouts)\nDon't come anywhere near this place!\nForeigners aren't welcome here!\nDUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.\nEXT. DESERT - DAY\nC/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.\nDUKE (V/O)\nWell.

I\nunderstood this now...\n(another blast from\nthe gun)\n... and with understanding came a\nsense of almost terminal relief.\nDUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the\nthuds of the explosions echo away.\nEXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY\nThe RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.\n63.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nI had to get rid of The Shark.

The rear\nwindows leapt up with a touch like\nfrogs in a dynamited pond.  The\ndashboard was full of esoteric\nlights and dials and meters that I\nwould never understand.\nEXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON\nA GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S\nCONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.\nDUKE (V/O)\nIf the Pigs were gathering in\nVegas, I felt the Drug Culture\nshould be represented as well...\nand there was a certain bent appeal\nin the notion of running a savage\nburn on one Las Vegas hotel and\nthen just wheeling across town and\nchecking into another.\nThe WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately\nattended by impressed MINIONS.\nDUKE (V/O)\nMe and a thousand ranking cops from\nall over America.  Why not?  Move\nconfidently into their midst.\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON\nDUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco\nshirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden\nbehind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.\n64.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nMy arrival was badly timed.\nTHE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all\ndressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,\nArnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.\nAhead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.\nThe POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,\nweeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.\nPOLICE CHIEF\nWhat do you mean I'm too late to\nregister?  I'm a police chief.\nFrom Michigan.

May I call you\na cab?\nThe POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...\nDUKE (V/O)\nOf course, I could hear what the\nClerk was really saying...\n65.\n\nCLERK\n(IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION)\nListen, you fuzzy little shithead --\nI've been fucked around, in my\ntime, by a fairly good cross-\nsection of mean-tempered rule-crazy\ncops and now it's MY turn. \"Fuck\nyou, officer, I'm in charge here,\nand I'm telling you we don't have\nroom for you.\"\nDUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.\nDUKE\nSay.  I hate to interrupt, but I\nwonder if maybe I could just sort\nof slide through and get out of\nyour way.  Name's Raoul Duke --\nRaoul Duke.  My attorney made the\nreservation.\nDUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE\ngoes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he\nwas some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The\nCLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.\nCLERK\nCertainly, Mr. Duke!\nDUKE\nMy bags are out there in that white\nCadillac convertible.  Can you have\nsomeone drive it around to the room?\nALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.\nDUKE\nOh, and could I get a quart of Wild\nTurkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and\na night's worth of ice delivered to\nmy room, please?\nCLERK\nDon't worry about a thing, sir.\nJust enjoy your stay.\nDUKE\nWell, thank you.\nDUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the\nelevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of\nbeer and toasts them.

This is Lucy.\n(laughing distractedly)\nYou know--like \"Lucy In The Sky\nWith Diamonds.\"\nLUCY eyes DUKE venomously.\nGONZO\nLucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit!\nRemember what happened at the\nairport!  No more of that, okay?\nLUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.

This is\nMr. Duke, the famous journalist.\nHe's paying for this suite, Lucy.\nHe's on our side.\nDUKE flops onto the sofa.\nGONZO\nMr. Duke is my friend.  He loves\nartists.\nDUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of\nartwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in\ncharcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.\nGONZO\nLucy paints portraits of Barbra\nStreisand.\n67.\n\nLUCY\nI drew these from TV.\nGONZO\nFantastic.  She came all the way\ndown here from Montana just to give\nthese portraits to Barbra.  We're\ngoing over to the Americana Hotel\ntonight to meet her backstage...\nDUKE's voice rises above GONZO.\nDUKE (V/O)\nI desperately needed peace, rest,\nsanctuary.  I hadn't counted on\nthis.  Finding my attorney on acid\nand locked into some kind of\npreternatural courtship.\nDUKE\nWell, I guess they brought the car\nround by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF\nOUT OF THE TRUNK.\nDUKE fixes GONZO hard.\nGONZO\nAbsolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF.\n(to LUCY)\nNow, we'll be right back.

Jesus,\nshe's never even had a drink.\nDUKE\nWell... It'll probably work out.\nWe can keep her loaded and peddle\nher ass at the drug convention.\nGONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.\nGONZO\nListen, she's running away from\nhome for something like the fifth\ntime in six months.  It's terrible.\nDUKE\nShe's perfect for this gig.  These\ncops will go fifty bucks a head to\nbeat her into submission and then\ngang fuck her.  We can set her up\nin one of these back street motels,\nhang pictures of Jesus all over the\nroom, then turn these pigs loose on\nher... Hell she's strong; she'll\nhold her own.\nGONZO's face twitches badly.\nGONZO\nJesus Christ.  I knew you were sick\nbut I never expected to hear you\nactually say that kind of stuff.\nDUKE\nIt's straight economics.  This girl\nis a god-send.  Shit, she can make\nus a grand a day.\nGONZO\nNO!  Stop talking like that.\nDUKE\nI figure she can do about four at a\ntime.  Christ, if we keep her full\nof acid that's more like two grand\na day.  Maybe three.\n69.\n\nGONZO\nYou filthy bastard.  I should cave\nyour fucking head in.\nDUKE\nIn a few hours, she'll probably be\nsane enough to work herself into a\ntowering Jesus-based rage at the\nhazy recollection of being seduced\nby some kind of cruel Samoan who\nfed her liquor and LSD, dragged her\nto a Vegas hotel room and savagely\npenetrated every orifice in her\nbody with his throbbing,\nuncircumcised member.\nGONZO starts crying.\nGONZO\nNO!  I felt sorry for the girl, I\nwanted to help her!\nDUKE\nYou'll go straight to the gas\nchamber.  And even if you manage to\nbeat that, they'll send you back to\nNevada for Rape and Consensual\nSodomy.  She's got to go.\nPause.\nGONZO\nShit, it doesn't pay to try to help\nsomebody these days.\nA silence.\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe only alternative was to take\nher out to the desert and feed her\nremains to the lizards.  But, it\nseemed a bit heavy for the thing we\nwere trying to protect: My attorney.\nGONZO\nWe have to cut her loose.  She's\ngot two hundred dollars.  And we\ncan always call the cops up there\nin Montana, where she lives, and\nturn her in.\nDUKE\nWhat?... What kind of goddamn\nmonster are you?\n70.\n\nGONZO\nIt just occurred to me, that she\nhas no witnesses.  Anything that\nshe says about us is completely\nworthless.\nDUKE\nUs?\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET\nDUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.\nDUKE\nHotel Americana?  I need a\nreservation.  For my niece.  Listen,\nI need her treated very gently.\nShe's an artist, and might seem a\ntrifle highstrung...\nIn the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the\ndoor.\nGONZO\nOkay, Lucy, it's time to go meet\nBarbra...\nDUKE (V/O)\nI felt like a Nazi, but it had to\nbe done.\nEXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK\nThe WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps\nLUCY and her paintings from the car.\nDUKE (V/O)\nLucy was a potentially fatal\nmillstone on both our necks.  There\nwas absolutely no choice but to cut\nher adrift and hope her memory was\nfucked.\nGONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --\nwaves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting\nto come down...\nGONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands\ntogether as if washing his hands of the situation.\nGONZO\nWell that's that.  Take off slowly.\nDon't attract attention.\n71.\n\nThey pull out into traffic.\nEXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK\nGONZO\nI gave the cabbie an extra ten\nbucks to make sure she gets there\nsafe.  Also, I told him I'd be\nthere myself in an hour, and if she\nwasn't, I'd come back out here and\nrip his lungs out.\nDUKE\nThat's good.  You can't be subtle\nin this town.\nGONZO\nAs your attorney, I advise you to\ntell me where you put the goddamn\nmescaline.\nDUKE\nMaybe we should take it easy tonight.\nGONZO\nRight.  Let's find a good seafood\nrestaurant and eat some red salmon.\nI feel a powerful lust for red\nsalmon...\nThe electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The\nsun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson\ntune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING\nGONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.\nIn the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.\nDUKE\nCome on, we're going to be late.\nGONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth\nwith a towel.\nGONZO\nThis goddamn mescaline.  Why the\nfuck can't they make it a little\nless pure?  Maybe mix it up with\nRolaids or something.\n72.\n\nINT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n(crackling and\nbooming over the\nlousy sound system)\nOn behalf of the prosecuting\nattorneys of this county, I welcome\nyou to the Third National DA's\nConference on Narcotics and\nDangerous Drugs.\nThe EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman\ntype -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:\nNATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. \"If You Don't Know, Come To\nLearn... If You Know, Come To Teach.\"\nA BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS\nAND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod\ndress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be\nWITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around\n20 REDNECKS.\nA dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles\ndistort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.\nAt the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI\nwingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name\ntag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.\nGONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,\nCRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.\nGONZO\n(lowers his voice)\nI saw these bastards in Easy Rider,\nbut I didn't believe they were real.\nNot like this.  Not hundreds of them!\nDUKE\nThey're actually nice people when\nyou get to know them.\nGONZO\nMan, I know these people in my\ngoddamn blood!\nDUKE\nDon't mention that word around here.\nYou'll get them excited.\nGONZO\nThis is a fucking nightmare.\n73.\n\nDUKE\nRight.  Sure as hell some dope-\ndealing bomb freak is going to\nrecognize you and put the word out\nthat you're partying with a thousand\ncops.\nCOP IN BACK\nSSSSHHH!\nDR. BLUMQUIST -- a \"drug expert\" -- takes the stage.\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nWe must come to terms with the Drug\nCulture in the country... country...\ncountry...\nThe sound systems echoes.\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nThe reefer butt is called a \"roach,\"\nbecause it resembles a cockroach...\ncockroach... cockroach...\nGONZO\n(whispers)\nWhat the fuck are these people\ntalking about?  You'd have to be\ncrazy on acid to think a joint\nlooked like a goddamn cockroach!\nDUKE (V/O)\nIt was clear that we had stumbled\ninto a prehistoric gathering.\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nNow, there are four states of being\nin the cannabis, or marijuana,\nsociety: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and\nSquare.  The square is seldom if\never cool.  He is not \"with it,\"\nthat is, he doesn't know \"what's\nhappening.\" But if he manages to\nfigure it out, he moves up a notch\nto \"hip.\"\nDUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.\nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D)\nAnd if he can bring himself to\napprove of what is happening, he\nbecomes \"groovy.\" After that, with\nmuch luck and perseverance, he can\nrise to the rank of \"cool.\" A cool\nguy... cool guy... cool guy...\n74.\n\nCOP IN BACK\nDr. Bloomquist, do you think the\nanthropologist, Margaret Mead's\nstrange behavior of late might\npossibly be explained by a private\nmarijuana addiction?\nDR. BLUMQUIST\nI really don't know, but at her\nage, if she did smoke grass, she'd\nhave one hell of a trip!\nRoars of laughter.\nGONZO\nI know a hell of a lot better ways\nto waste my time than listening to\nthis bullshit.\nHe stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and\nplunges down the aisle to the door.\nCOP IN BACK\nDown in front!\nGONZO\nFuck you!  I have to get out!  I\ndon't belong here!\nCOP IN BACK\nGood riddance!\nHe stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to\nthe stage.\nThe lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER\nMADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.\nFILM NARRATOR\nKNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE\nMAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be\nable to see his eyes because of\nTea-Shades, but his knuckles will\nbe white from inner tension...\nDUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF\nwho necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.\nFILM NARRATOR\n... and his pants will be crusted\nwith semen from constantly jacking\noff when he can't find a rape\nvictim...\n75.\n\nDUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,\nhe gets up, hand over mouth.\nDUKE\nPardon me, I feel sick.\nFILM NARRATOR\nHe will stagger and babble when\nquestioned.  He will not respect\nyour badge.  The Dope Fiend fears\nnothing.  He will attack, for no\nreason, with every weapon at his\ncommand -- including yours...\nDUKE heads for the exit.\nDUKE\nSorry, sick... Beg pardon!  Feeling\nsick...\nFILM NARRATOR\nBEWARE.  Any officer apprehending a\nsuspected marijuana addict should\nuse all necessary force immediately.\nOne stitch in time  will\nusually save nine on you.\nDUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.\nINT. CASINO BAR - DAY\nDUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING\nCOP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT\nATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.\nDA\nI'm a whiskey man myself.  We don't\nhave much trouble from drugs where\nI come from...\nGONZO\nYou will.  One of these nights\nyou'll wake up and find a junkie\ntearing your bedroom apart.\nDA\nNaw!\nGONZO\nThey'll climb right into your\nbedroom and sit on your chest with\nbig Bowie knives.  They might even\nsit on your wife's chest.  Put the\nblade right down on her throat.\n76.\n\nDA\nNot down in my parts.\nDUKE joins them.\nDUKE\n(to WAITRESS)\nRum and ice, please.\nDA\n(looks at DUKE'S NAME TAG)\nYou're another one of these\nCalifornia boys.  Your friend\nhere's been tellin' us about dope\nfiends.\nDUKE\nThey're everywhere.  Nobody's safe.\nAnd sure as hell not in the South.\nThey like warm weather... You'd\nnever believe it.  In L.A. it's out\nof control.  First it was drugs,\nnow it's witchcraft.\nDA\nWitchcraft?  Shit, you can't mean it!\nThe BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the\nconversation.\nGONZO\nRead the newspapers.\nDUKE\nMan, you don't know trouble until\nyou have to face down a bunch of\nthese addicts gone crazy for human\nsacrifice!\nDA\nNaw!  That's science fiction stuff!\nDUKE\nNot where we operate.\nGONZO\nHell, in Malibu alone, these\ngoddamn Satan worshippers kill six\nor eight people every day.  All\nthey want is the blood.  They'll\ntake people right off the street if\nthey have to.\n77.\n\nDUKE\nJust the other day we had a case\nwhere they grabbed a girl right out\nof a McDonald's hamburger stand.\nShe was a waitress, about sixteen\nyears old... with a lot of people\nwatching, too!\nThe BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more\nfuriously.\nDA\nWhat happened?  What did they do to\nher?\nGONZO\nDo?  Jesus Christ, man.  They\nchopped her goddamn head off right\nthere in the parking lot!  Then\nthey cut all kinds of holes in her\nhead and sucked out the blood!\nDA\n(DA ad-libs a\nsummation of the crime)\nAnd nobody did anything?\nDUKE\nWhat could they do?  The guy that\ntook the head was about six-seven,\nand maybe three-hundred pounds.  He\nwas packing two Lugers, and the\nothers had M-16s.\nGONZO\nThey just ran back out into Death\nValley -- you know, where Manson\nturned up...\nDUKE\nLike big lizards.\nGONZO\n... and every one of them stacked\nnaked...\nDA\nNaked!?\nDUKE\nNaked.\n78.\n\nGONZO\nYeh, naked!... except for the\nweapons.\nDUKE\nThey were all veterans.\nDA\nVeterans?!!!?\nAgog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes\nthe glass -- faster and faster...\nGONZO\nYeh.  The big guy used to be a\nmajor in the Marines.\nDA\nA major!\nGONZO\nWe know where he lives, but we\ncan't get near the house.\nDA\nNaw!  Not a major.\nGONZO\nHe wanted the pineal gland.\nDA\nReally?\nGONZO\nThat's how he got so big.  When he\nquit the Marines he was just a\nlittle guy.\nDUKE\nUsually, it's whole families.\nDuring the night.  Most of them\ndon't even wake up until they feel\ntheir heads going -- and then, of\ncourse, it's too late.\nThe glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nHappens every day.\nDUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.\n79.\n\nDUKE (CONT'D)\nThree more rums.  Plenty of ice.\nMaybe a handful of lime chunks.\nWAITRESS\nAre you guys with the police\nconvention upstairs?\nDA\nWe sure are, Miss.\nWAITRESS\nI thought so.  I never heard that\nkind of talk around here before.\nJesus Christ!  How do you guys\nstand that kind of work?\nGONZO\n(grinning)\nWe like it.  It's groovy.\nThe WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.\nDUKE\nWhat's wrong with you?  Hell,\nsomebody has to do it.\nGONZO\nHurry up with those drinks.  We're\nthirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine\na Bloody Mary.\nDA\n(whacks his fist on\nthe bar)\nHell, I really hate to hear this.\nBecause everything that happens in\nCalifornia seems to get down our\nway, sooner or later.  Mostly\nAtlanta.  But that was back when\nthe goddamn bastards were peaceful.\nAll we had to do was to keep 'em\nunder surveillance.  They didn't\nroam around much... But now Jesus,\nit seems nobody's safe.\nGONZO\n(with a conspiratorial\nnod)\nYou're going to need to take the\nbull by the horns -- go to the mat\nwith this scum.\n80.\n\nDA\nWhat do you mean by that?\nGONZO\nYou know what I mean.  We've done\nit before and we can damn well do\nit again!\nDUKE\nCut their goddamn heads off.  Every\none of them.  That's what we're\ndoing in California.\nDA\n(stupefied)\nWHAT?\nGONZO\nSure.  It's all on the Q.T., but\neverybody who matters is with us\nall the way down the line.\nDUKE\nWe keep it quiet.  It's not the\nkind of thing you'd want to talk\nabout upstairs.  Not with the press\naround.\nDA\n(recovering slightly)\nHell, no.  We'd never hear the\ngoddamn end of it.\nDUKE\nDobermans don't talk.\nDA\nWhat?\nGONZO\nSometimes it's easier to just rip\nout the backstraps.\nDUKE\nThey'll fight like hell if you try\nto take the head without the dogs.\nDA\nGod almighty!\n(muttering in a daze)\nI don't think I should tell my wife\nabout this.  She'd never understand.\nYou know how women are.\n81.\n\nDUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.\nDUKE\nJust be thankful your heart is\nyoung and strong.\nDUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the\nswirling ice in drink.\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\nDUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.\nGONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the\nbathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.\nThe phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,\npicks up the phone.\nDUKE\nWhat's the message?  My light is\nblinking.\nCLERK (V/O)\nAh, yes.  Mr. Duke?  You have one\nmessage: \"Call Lucy at the Americana\nHotel, room 1600.\"\nDUKE\nHoly shit!\nDUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the\nbathroom -- looking like death.\nDUKE\nLucy called.\nGONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.\nGONZO\nWhat?\nThe telephone rings.  DUKE answers.\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY\nA worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.\nCLERK\nMr. Duke?  Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm\nsorry we were cut off a moment\nago... I thought I should call\nagain, because I was wondering...\n82.\n\nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY\nDUKE\nWHAT?\n(hand over the PHONE)\nWhat was that crazy bitch said to\nhim?\n(screams)\nThere's a war on, man!  People are\nbeing killed!\nCLERK (V/O)\nKilled?\nDUKE\nIN VIETNAM!  ON THE GODDAMN\nTELEVISION!\nCLERK (V/O)\nOh... yes... yes... This terrible\nwar.  When will it end?\nDUKE\nTell me.  What do you want?\nIn the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his\nstash from the lining.\nCLERK (V/O)\nThe woman who left that message for\nyou sounded very disturbed.  I\nthink she was crying...\nDUKE\nCrying?  Why was she crying?\nCLERK (V/O)\nWell, uh.  She didn't say Mr. Duke.\nBut since I know you're here with\nthe Police Convention...\nDUKE\nLook, you want to be gentle with\nthat woman if she ever calls again.\nWe're watching her very carefully...\nthis woman has been into laudanum.\nIt's a controlled experiment, but I\nsuspect we'll need your cooperation\nbefore this thing is over.\nCLERK (V/O)\n(hesitantly)\nWell, certainly... We're always\nhappy to cooperate with the police...\n83.\n\nDUKE\nDon't worry.  You're protected.\nJust treat this poor woman like\nyou'd treat any other human being\nin trouble.\nCLERK (V/O)\nWhat?  Ah... yes, yes, I see what\nyou mean... Yes... so, you'll be\nresponsible then?\nDUKE\nOf course.  And now I have to get\nback to the news.  Send up some ice.\nHe hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.\nGONZO\nGood work.  They'll treat us like\ngoddamn lepers after that.\nDUKE\n(slowly, carefully)\nLucy is looking for you.\nGONZO\n(laughing)\nNo, she's looking for you.\nDUKE\nMe?\nGONZO\nShe really flipped over you.  The\nonly way I could get rid of her was\nby saying you were taking me out to\nthe desert for a showdown -- that\nyou wanted me out of the way so you\ncould have her all to yourself.\n(laughing again)\nI guess she figures you won.  That\nphone message wasn't for me, was it?\nA look of stunned realization from DUKE...\nINT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY\nLUCY is on the witness stand.\nLUCY\nYessir, those two men in the dock\nare the ones who gave me the LSD\nand took me to the hotel.\n84.\n\nA doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.\nLUCY\nI don't know for sure what they\ndone to me, but I remember it was\nhorrible.\nJUDGE\nTwenty years... and Double\nCastration!\nThe JUDGE bangs his gavel.\nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY\nDUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.\nGONZO\nWait!  You can't leave me alone in\nthis snake pit.  This room is in my\nname.\nDUKE KEEPS PACKING.

Let me handle this.\n(dials the PHONE,\nsnaps angrily at DUKE)\nYou'd make a piss-poor lawyer.\n...Room 1600, please.\n(to DUKE)\nAs your attorney, I advise you not\nto worry.\n(nods towards bathroom)\nTake a hit out of that little brown\nbottle in my shaving kit.\nDUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a\nlabel: \"DRINK ME.\"\nDUKE\nWhat is this?\n85.\n\nGONZO\nYou won't need much.  Just a little\ntiny taste, that stuff makes pure\nmescaline seem like ginger-beer.\nAdrenochrome.\nDUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.\nDUKE\nAdrenochrome...\nGONZO\n(into PHONE)\nHi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got\nyour message...what?  Hell, no, I\ntaught the bastard a lesson he'll\nnever forget... what?  No, not\ndead, but he won't be bothering\nanybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left\nhim out there, I stomped him, then\npulled all his teeth out...\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a\nterrible thing to lay on somebody\nwith a head full of acid.\"\nDUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies\nit -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...\nGONZO\n(to PHONE)\nBut here's the problem.  That\nbastard cashed a bad check\ndownstairs and gave you as a\nreference.  They'll be looking for\nboth of you.  Yeah, I know, but you\ncan't judge a book by its cover,\nLucy.  Some people are just\nbasically rotten... Anyway, the\nlast thing you want to do is call\nthis hotel again; they'll trace the\ncall and put you straight behind\nbars... no, I'm moving to the\nTropicana right away.  I have to\ngo, they've got the phone tapped.\nYeah, I know, it was horrible, but\nit's all over now... OH MY GOD!\nTHEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN!\n(throws the PHONE\ndown; shouts)\nNo!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent!\nIt was Duke!  I swear to God!\n(MORE)\n86.\n\nGONZO (CONT'D)\n(stomps the PHONE; moans)\nNo, I don't know where she is.\nYou'll never catch Lucy!  She's\ngone!  I swear, I don't know where\nshe is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME!\n(slams the PHONE down)\n\nGONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.\nGONZO\nWell.  That's that.  She's probably\nstuffing herself down the\nincinerator about now.  That's the\nlast we should be hearing from Lucy.\n(fumbling with the\nhash pipe)\nWhere's the opium?\nDUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY\nSTRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...\nDUKE (V/O)\nI remember slumping on the bed, his\nperformance had given me a bad jolt.\nFor a moment I thought his mind had\nsnapped -- that he actually believed\nhe was being attacked by invisible\nenemies.  But the room was quiet\nagain.\nDUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.\nDUKE\nWhere'd you get this?\nGONZO\nNever mind, it's absolutely pure.\nDUKE\nJesus... what kind of monster\nclient have you picked up this time?\nThere's only one source for this\nstuff -- the adrenaline gland from\na living human body!\nGONZO turns to smile at DUKE.\n87.\n\nGONZO\nI know, but the guy didn't have any\ncash to pay me.  He's one of these\nSatanism freaks.  He offered me\nhuman blood -- said it would take\nme higher than I've ever been in my\nlife.\n(laughs -- struts\nround DUKE -- eyes\nbright with expectation)\nI thought he was kidding, so I told\nhim I'd just as soon have an ounce\nor so of pure adrenochrome -- or\nmaybe just a fresh adrenaline gland\nto chew on.\nDUKE (V/O)\nI could already feel the stuff\nworking on me -- the first wave\nfelt like a combination of mescaline\nand methedrine -- maybe I should\ntake a swim, I thought...\nDUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...\nGONZO\nYeah, they nailed this guy for\nchild molesting.  He swore he\ndidn't do it. \"Why should I fuck\nwith children?\" he says. \"They're\ntoo small.\" Christ, werewolf is\nentitled to legal counsel.  I\ndidn't dare turn the creep down.\nHe might have picked up a letter\nopener and gone after my pineal\ngland!\nGONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS\nGOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.\nDUKE\nWhy not?  We should get some of\nthat.  Just eat a big handful and\nsee what happens.\nGONZO\nSome of what?\nDUKE\n(spitting words)\nExtract of pineal!\n88.\n\nGONZO\n(STARING AT DUKE WITH\nA STRANGE SMILE)\nSure.  That's a good idea.  One\nwhiff of that shit would turn you\ninto something out of a goddamn\nmedical encyclopedia.\nGONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.\nGONZO\nMan, your head would swell up like\na watermelon, you'd probably gain\nabout a hundred pounds in two\nhours...\nA CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.\nDUKE\nRight!\nGONZO\n... grow claws... bleeding warts.\nGONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.\nDUKE\nYes!\nGONZO\n... then you'd notice about six\nhuge hairy tits swelling up on your\nback...\nA TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A\nFLAME RED DEMON!\nDUKE\nFantastic!\nDUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY\nat the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.

He is purplish-red.\nOVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!\nDUKE\nMaybe you could just... shove me\ninto the pool, or something...\nGONZO shakes his head disgustedly.\nGONZO\nIf I put you in the pool right now,\nyou'd sink like a goddamn stone.\nYou took too much.  Jesus, look at\nyour face, you're about to explode.\nGONZO sits back down... watching the TV.\nGONZO\nDon't try and fight it, or you'll\nget brain bubbles.  Strokes,\naneurysms.

FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT\nDarkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- \"Put the\nlime in the coconut and mix em all up...\"\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhat kind of rat-bastard psychotic\nwould play that song -- right now,\nat this moment?\nDUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,\nawkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been\nthere days -- months.\nDUKE (V/O)\nWhen I came to the general back\nalley ambiance of the suite was so\nrotten, so incredibly foul.  How\nlong had I been lying there?  Hours?\nDays?  Months?  All these signs of\nviolence.  What had happened?\nDUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE\nSIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving\nwhisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights\nreplace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,\npornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered\non a shattered mirror.\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was evidence in this room of\nexcessive consumption of almost\nevery type of drug known to\ncivilized man since 1544 AD.\nDUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --\nHOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.\nDUKE (V/O)\nBut what kind of addict would need\nall these coconut husks and crushed\nhoneydew rinds?  Would the presence\nof junkies account for all these\nuneaten french fries?  These\npuddles of glazed ketchup on the\nbureau?  Maybe so, but then why all\nthis booze?  And these crude\npornographic photos smeared with\nmustard that had dried to a hard\nyellow crust...\nDUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT\nRAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.\n91.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThese were not the hoof prints of\nyour normal god-fearing junkie.  It\nwas too savage, too aggressive.\nQUICK FLASHBACK:\nGONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:\nBACK IN THE ROOM:\nDUKE stares at the smashed mirror.\nDUKE (V/O)\nGrim memories and bad flashbacks.\nIn the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN\nVOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.\nDUKE unzips and pisses.

I was\nsure of it...\nDUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.\nThe SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.\nDUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out\nof the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE\nSMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...\nsleeping on the sofa.\nThe ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.\nA hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO\ngrappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is\nmuffling her screams with an ice bag.\nMAID\nPlease... please... I'm only the\nmaid.  I didn't mean nothin!...\nDUKE\n(jumps up from the\nbed, flashing his\npress badge)\nYOU'RE UNDER ARREST!\n92.\n\nGONZO\n(to DUKE)\nShe must have used a pass key.

I'm the maid!\nGONZO\nYou're lying!  You were after the\nevidence.  Who put you up to\nthis -- the manager?\nMAID\nI don't know what you're talking\nabout!\nGONZO\nBullshit!  You're just as much a\npart of it as they are!\nMAID\nPart of what?\nDUKE\nThe dope ring.  You must know\nwhat's going on in this hotel.  Why\ndo you think we're here?\nMAID\n(blubbering)\nI know you're cops, but I thought\nyou were just here for that\nconvention.  I swear!  All I wanted\nto do was clean up the room.  I\ndon't know anything about dope!\nGONZO laughs.\nGONZO\nCome on, baby don't try to tell us\nyou never heard of the Grange Gorman.\n93.\n\nMAID\nNo!  No!  I swear to Jesus I never\nheard of that stuff!\nDUKE\nMaybe she's telling the truth.\nMaybe she's not part of it.\nMAID\nNo!  I swear I'm not!\nGONZO\n(long pause)\nIn that case, maybe she can help.\nMAID\nYes!  I'll help you all you need!\nI hate dope!\nDUKE\nSo do we, lady.\nGONZO\n(helping her up)\nI think we should put her on the\npayroll.  See what she comes up with.\nDUKE\nDo you think you can handle it?\nMAID\nWhat?\nGONZO\nOne phone call every day.  Just\ntell us what you've seen.  Don't\nworry if it doesn't add up, that's\nour problem.\nGONZO hustles the MAID to the door.\nMAID\nYou'd pay me for that?\nDUKE\nYou're damn right.  But the first\ntime you say anything about this,\nto anybody -- you'll go straight to\nprison for the rest of your life.\nWhat's your name?\nMAID\nAlice.  Just ring Linen Service and\nask for Alice.\n94.\n\nGONZO\nAlright, Alice... you'll be\ncontacted by Inspector Rock.\nArthur Rock.  He'll be posing as a\npolitician.\nDUKE\nInspector Rock will pay you.  In\ncash.  A thousand dollars on the\nninth of every month.\nMAID\nOh Lord!  I'd do just about anything\nfor that!\nGONZO\nYou and a lot of other people.\nDUKE\nThe password is: \"One Hand Washes\nThe Other.\" The minute you hear\nthat, you say \"I fear nothing.\"\nMAID\nI fear nothing.\nShe repeats the password several times while they listen to\nmake sure she has it right.\nGONZO\nOh, and don't bother to make up the\nroom.  That way we won't have to\nrisk another of these little\nincidents, will we?\nMAID\nWhatever you say, gentlemen.  I\ncan't tell you how sorry I am about\nwhat happened...\nGONZO\nDon't worry, it's all over now.\nThank God for the decent people.\nShe smiles, repeating to herself \"One Hand Washes The Other\"\nas GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.\nCUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.\nA grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.\nGONZO ON TAPE\n... Thank God for the decent people.\n95.\n\nDUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his\nmangled tape recorder in front of him.\nDUKE (V/O)\nMemories of that night are extremely\nhazy...\nDUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: \"Awwww,\nmama... can this really...be the end...?\"\nEXT.

They\nsend DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.\nThe trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather\nat the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with\njunk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.\nDUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects\na coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO\npulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering\nCROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!\nA GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.\nDUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat\nflies everywhere.\nSHOPPER #1\nHey!  Is that your car?\nDUKE\nSure is.\nSMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.\nDUKE\nAny of you folks want the milk?\nWe're after the meat.

GONZO jumps in.\nDUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.\nDUKE\nYou people voted for Hubert Humphrey!\nYou killed Jesus!\nThey swerve round and through the CROWD.\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe crowd broke ranks.

What's the bail?  I\nwant that ape!  I've already\nreserved two first-class seats on\nthe plane.\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was every reason to believe\nthat we had been heading for\ntrouble, that we'd pushed our luck\na bit far...\nINT. WHITE WHALE ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT\nGONZO SCREAMS ABUSE out of the window at a Ford alongside\nthe VOMIT STREAKED WHITE WHALE.

Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the\ncounter.\nINT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT\nDUKE (V/O)\nThe North Star Coffee Lounge seemed\nlike a fairly safe haven from our\nstorms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just\na place to rest and regroup.  I\nwasn't even hungry.\nGONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE\nBEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.\n102.\n\nDUKE (V/O)\nThere was nothing in the atmosphere\nof the North Star to put me on my\nguard...\nGONZO\n(to WAITRESS)\nTwo glasses of ice water with ice.\nThe WAITRESS brings the ice water.\nDUKE (V/O)\nShe looked like a burnt out\ncaricature of Jane Russell.

He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-\nSHARP HUNTING KNIFE.\nGONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.

You were\nsupposed to turn back there!\nDUKE (V/O)\nWe had abused every rule that Vegas\nlived by -- burning the locals,\nabusing the tourists, terrifying\nthe help.  The only chance now, I\nfelt, was the possibility that we'd\ngone to such excess that nobody in\nthe position to bring the hammer\ndown on us could possibility\nbelieve it.\nDUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.\n105.\n\nGONZO\nJesus Christ!!!\nThere, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her\npaintings under her arm -- looking lost.

He is typing on his\ntypewriter.\nDUKE\nWe are all wired into a survival\ntrip now.  No more of the speed\nthat fueled that 60's.  That was\nthe fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.\nHe crashed around America selling\n\"consciousness expansion\" without\never giving a thought to the grim\nmeat-hook realities that were lying\nin wait for all the people who took\nhim seriously...\nDUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.

DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE\nCAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...\nDUKE\n... a generation of permanent\ncripples, failed seekers, who never\nunderstood the essential old-mystic\nfallacy of the Acid Culture: the\ndesperate assumption that somebody...\nor at least some force -- is\ntending the light at the end of the\ntunnel.\nHIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX\nSURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON\nSIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT\nLIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.\n108.\n\nEXT.

ONLY REAL.\nPROPRIETOR\nWhat'll you have?\nDUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.\nDUKE\n(doubtfully)\nBallantine Ale...?\nTHE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.

A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY\nPIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack\nreads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.\n109.\n\nPROPRIETOR\nWhere ya comin' from, young man?\nDUKE\nLas Vegas.\nPROPRIETOR\nA great town, that Vegas.  I bet\nyou had good luck there.
