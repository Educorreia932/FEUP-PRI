Errrrr\nNow he's his chest peaked in\nNigga I'm Barry Allen, I keep the Flash on me\nI know your homies want you to spaz on me\nBut the receptions bold\nThey givin' you credit for bars, and this is cash only\nNigga I smash cronies\nYou even havin' half a chance is a happenstance\nNigga I wear 44's because of the .44, these is my Hammer pants\nI will 'Turn This Mutha Out', you better 'Pray' I don't show you how this Hammer dance\nI got all this Will and one Smith gon' make me legendary like Bagger Vance\nMan, niggas know what's up\nYeah nigga I'm a sharp shooter, you can't hurt me\nI'ma make yo' bitch swallow everything, that's why I'm dressed like Kirby\nNigga, there's only three things promised in life\nNigga, that's death and taxes and my legend status\nWhen you play the game as good as Iverson\nThey should never expect you to step in practice\nGo 'head lil' nigga and do yo' lil' rap shit\nKillers!\n\nNow, since Covid we've seen a slight change in the program\nWe got small crowds, but you be sweating like it ain't no fans\nAnd I got energy either way, they know I'm a go HAM\nAnd you Stinkmeaner, they need me to exercise an old man\nSee, after I beat Dizaster I could not dot my verse down, I had writer's block\nThought of Real Deal then knocked out the first round\nYou told Charron you was more gat clapper than backpacker\nBut you have no identity, other than being a fat rapper\nBut lemme guess, I ain't battle nobody to test me yet\nSo I'm supposed to expect the best out of Rick Ross Dress for Less\nYou got no bars, you just usin' your weight as another gimmick\nYou from the world famous Fat Fucking Killers, what y'all do? Smother bitches?\nThen spend your royalty checks on a couple pizzas for carry out?\nBody Mass Index, only BMI you should care about\nShit, I'm underweight so in this tourney both of use gettin' right\nCause I started eatin' and Marv went on the longest run of his life\nNow, I know that's a lot of jokes about weight, that's were it stops\nIt's time to throw him in a car compactor and wait to hear it pop\nOr I'll catch you while you at Outback with an appetite, a hundred shots\nEven the servers go down when I crash the site\nOr I'll pull up to your house broad day, I'm reckless with it\nCause this nigga fat as fuck, I ain't even tryin' to catch him slippin'\nDisregards stuff, clip longer than one of Marv's belts\nTeam Homi? Man, y'all niggas finna need one of y'all help\nCause y'all sent this man to me\nI hope you're there when ya men dead\nThis Team Homi suicide, like Aaron Hernandez\nShit, I'm hoping this nigga chokin' in , like Matt Ryan\nThis rapper can't make his memory stick, just like the Flash drivin'\nUseless, watchin' you on this ride is a hard trip\nIt's like a rollercoaster, and you too fat to lock yo' bars in\nHe choke on his gun bars\nLike he don't know what to say\nIt's no surprise the hungry man froze up with the tray (tre)\nAnd that's when the K spark, I clap at his main parts\nGet half of ya face blew (blue) for not having a brave heart (Braveheart)\nYou made it all the way to the finals, be thrilled\nDon't fight back, just get a kid a dub, like Meek Mill\nOr take double, shit, I'm really thinkin' you'll love the plan\nI'll take the 50 cause I know you'll be satisfied with a 100 Grand\nAnd when this ends and you still obese, but we don't care after\nJust call T-Rex cause he don't blink and you gonna need a stare master (Stairmaster)\nBut I'd imagine he would be more focused on crack than calories\nIt's tragic because you need mo' protein than massive athletes\nAnd you drink like three Coronas and half a daiquiri\nYour intestines like, \"We don't need no mo' bro. We at capacity.\"\nTime\n\nNow that the intros over, lets get to the favorite part of the song\nIt's ironic you droppin' candy cause that's exact where yo' bars belong\nNigga, I used to be you\nI was mad at the masses cause I had talent and they denyin' it\nKnowin' I could've been teachin' they asses classes on classics on my defiantness\nNow my, footprints are Jurassic and I've mastered the role of Christ in this\nYou gonna try to not paint me great\nBut I'm not a patron Saynt (saint)\nI'm not buyin' it\nNigga this finna get nasty like finger fuckin' Mother Theresa under the bleachers\nI can tell you, just young and facetious with the dumbest of teachers\nI'll send some shells to\nCome in and great you, have fun wit' ya features\nFuck what they sell you, boy we punish the geekers\nPolice run from the creatures\nNigga, now I don't know if you know, but somebody had better tell this shorty\nI was born in '81, I'm literally close as hell to the .40\nNow everything ain't a joke, but I'm movin' like Chappelle with the story\nAnd niggas claim that they want smoke, until they in Hell, inhalin' it for me\nNigga, I'm in an age bracket, where I literally have raised ratchets\nAnd these little bitches never listen, they always go for the same tactics\nThey make the craziest decisions, they actually belong in some straight jackets\nBut they wanna be beauticians\nThey gon' part yo' shit and push yo' braids backwards\nNigga, I'm leavin' here with that money, that's whether or not Marvin wins\nEverybody wanna play games, until I show them somethin' to slide a cartridge in\nNigga I'm in yo' bushes wit' a Tommy, that works\nSo it's nothin' like Martin's friend\nThat's on God\nAnd where ever Saynt goes nigga we marchin' in\nBoy I'ma make his money work for me\nI'm takin' all that and then some\nAnd he knows better than to put up a fight\nYeah I'm takin' all this passive's income\nBoy, what I got will clear the room room\nNigga, y'all gassed him up; vroom vroom\nMy niggas pitchin' chicken out the kitchen like the spoon goon\nI lift it, now I click it, now he's twitchin' nigga; boom boom\nHe ain't listen now he missin', he was put in positions too soon\nR.I.P. Doom\nEvery round of this tournament you've been cryin' for respect\nI'll never give you that satisfaction, all you'll get is silence from the vet\nI'm Osiris with the flex\nThis ain't the virus you should catch\nYou not a gangsta you an actor, it's totally different when you dyin' on the set\nBoy it's only three things promised in life, that's death and taxes and my legend status\nWhen you play the game as good as Iverson\nThey should never expect you to step in practice\nGo 'head lil' nigga and do yo' lil' rap shit\n\nNow, it was obvious that Marvelous was gonna try to big bro me\nYou are overweight, but get this straight, you are not the big homie\nI was born in '96, the year Iverson went first in the draft, before they picked Kobe\nMaybe if Iverson actually went to practice, he would have been Kobe\nYou in the land where the Mamba was few dudes' idol\nYou told Times you are like Iverson, it's only right that you gon' lose in the final\nBut they want me to lose my spot, man, that shit is illogical\nI survived Dizaster's wave so I did the Impossible\nPlus, he called me a \"game freak\", shit, I'm top of my class\nI beat my rival, now there's a Snorlax blockin' my path\nMatter of fact, where's your partner? I'm cookin' him next\nDiz was right, I'm a game nerd, now I'm lookin' for Quest\nCause he gonna say you won regardless and ride for his old brother\nSo he gonna feel like Batman when I'm robbin' (Robin) his Boy Wonder\nCause for the Benjamins this January we can't debate\nI'll be the winner and when the snow fall (Snowfall) they'll call me \"Franklin Saint\"\nAnd I can't complain but you was cryin' to Swayze and we ain't tryna hear it\nEverybody is buyin' liquor\nSo you opened up to show your whining (wine and) spirit\nSo I'ma let a couple show you God, give you the Winans' spirit\nI drop jewels, but you tryna tell me that I am wrong\nNow I'm wildin' out (Wild 'N Out), fire in (firin') the Cannon like Viacom\nBut try to follow this, I'm like Kirk Franklin just not as friendly\nCause I'd had 'Stomp'ed through the whole GP, are you with me?\nYou did WRC, but we don't think that's important\nI look at you and see an urban dictionary, yeah a black Thesaurus\nYou lost 50 to Pete then stole the tapes, that's not cool\nI know that 50 fuck with your mind to this day, you Ja Rule\nHow you a legend? You ain't given your city a different life\nY'all can't even fix the pipes in ya hoods and it isn't right\nY'all got lead all through the water like the Israelites\nI mean, at the least the nigga Trice went platinum, you still holdin' on\nProbably mad like Anakin, I know you have contempt for Obi(e) Wan (Won)\nSo we can fight in the field and be inside before it's dark\nI'm not handicapped but we still can find the closest park\nYou be rappin' slow and it's some stupid shit that you have to know\nNone of the punches from Wonder land (Wonderland) cause you're draggin' us down the rabbit hole\nOn God, you was dead before they sent the deposit\nJust face facts, like the police when they send a composite\nYou from the North? You rob me outside some cars'll wait\nThose are wise men cause they gonna follow this North Star for Saynt\nI killed Dizaster then after today I'll be rid of you\nI 30 legends back to back on cam cause y'all Expendable\nThis nigga's dead, feelin' like he ate a 100 shell clip\n100 bucks to his chest, boy that's money well spent\n\nNow this gonna be the part of the battle where everybody expects me to big bro\nThey gon' want me to chop you down but leave you with some seeds that'll help grow you\nFor what nigga? I don't know you\nJust cause I'm the old you don't mean that I owe you\nBut if you willin' to listen\nThere are a couple of things that I'm willin' to show you\nYou see all these niggas behind you?\nThe peanut gallery\nSee, now they all frontin' like they ya peer group\nBut less than a month ago when you battled Diz they was all bettin' on him to clear you\nNigga you know why they cheer you?\nIt's not cause they love you they fear you\nNigga they gotta act like they happy for your success so they can be near you and have a career too\nNigga, I have been here dude\nThey gonna offer you somethin' that's real love but it's real hate\nYou better get your shit together\nOr be the last one to get the shot like Bill Gates\nNigga, they gonna say you let 'em starve but they really thumb they nose while you offered them real plates\nI'm talkin' .38 to the right, .48 to the left, .40 up the middle\nWell that's the only combination that makes me feel safe\nNigga, I feel Drake\nThese motherfuckas never loved us...or whatever the fuck he say\nNow you watchin' Ghost on Power just layin' around wit' yo' musty bay\nBut damn Saynt, Patrick Swayze was the real Ghost\n......Wait he ain't even catch the fuckin' play\nI said, \"Ghost\", \"Saint\", \"Patrick\" {gun cocks} nigga today just ain't yo' lucky day\nNigga you don't deserve this\nYou know how many nights I got overworked and underpaid?\nWhen niggas got cold feet and I had to save events that was already underway\nWhen corporations thought battle rap was a joke\nI was one of the ones who showed 'em we didn't come to play\nSo you goddamn right I want my roses...so I can lay these bitches on yo' fuckin' grave\nNigga, now this is yo' moment, is you gon' own it?\nYou either gon Real Deal it or Charron it\nI Lil' Wayne'd it, I grabbed a 'Milli' the second they showed me my opponent\nI just wanna make Detroit proud\nNigga, gunplay is an artform\nThe gat'll spray paint\nWe celebrate\nSo when you hear him screamin' \"Jesus Christ\" it's just the ladder they Saynt (Latter Day Saint)\nNigga you thinkin' you can beat me?\nMy nigga is you hooked on glass?\nHow do y'all niggas think y'all better than Bobby Flay in this cookin' class?\nNigga, if you mess with me you can get the step daddy combo, that's the hook and the jab\nOr, I'ma take this brand new pretty belt of mine and tell  yo' mama that I whooped yo' ass\nNigga I'ma motherfuckin' legend, nigga are you crazy dude?\nA real eastside nigga, and I just brought them .380's through\nAnd the last thing he gon' see is that D over that navy blue\nLike, \"Nigga, look what you made me do.\"",
