          "lyrics":"Chapter 13\nThe Nipponese businessman lies cut in segments on The Black Sun's floor. Surprisingly (he looks so real when he's in one piece), no flesh, blood, or organs are visible through the new cross-sections that Hiro's sword made through his body. He is nothing more than a thin shell of epidermis, an incredibly complex inflatable doll. But the air does not rush out of him, he fails to collapse, and you can look into the aperture of a sword cut and see, instead of bones and meat, the back of the skin on the other side.\nIt breaks the metaphor. The avatar is not acting like a real body. It reminds all The Black Sun's patrons that they are living in a fantasy world. People hate to be reminded of this.\nWhen Hiro wrote The Black Sun's sword-fighting algorithms--code that was later picked up and adopted by the entire Metaverse--he discovered that there was no good way to handle the aftermath. Avatars are not supposed to die. Not supposed to fall apart. The creators of the Metaverse had not been morbid enough to foresee a demand for this kind of thing. But the whole point of a sword fight is to cut someone up and kill them. So Hiro had to kludge something together, in order that the Metaverse would not, over time, become littered with inert, dismembered avatars that never decayed.\nSo the first thing that happens, when someone loses a sword fight, is that his computer gets disconnected from the global network that is the Metaverse. He gets chucked right out of the system. It is the closest simulation of death that the Metaverse can offer, but all it really does is cause the user a lot of annoyance.\nFurthermore, the user finds that he can't get back into the Metaverse for a few minutes. He can't log back on. This is because his avatar, dismembered, is still in the Metaverse, and it's a rule that your avatar can't exist in two places at once. So the user can't get back in until his avatar has been disposed of.\nDisposal of hacked-up avatars is taken care of by Graveyard Daemons, a new Metaverse feature that Hiro had to invent. They are small lithe persons swathed in black, like ninjas, not even their eyes showing. They are quiet and efficient. Even as Hiro is stepping back from the hacked-up body of his former opponent, they are emerging from invisible trapdoors in The Black Sun's floor, climbing up out of the netherworid, converging on the fallen businessman. Within seconds, they have stashed the body parts into black bags. Then they climb back down through their secret trapdoors and vanish into hidden tunnels beneath The Black Sun's floor. A couple of curious patrons try to follow them, try to pry open the trapdoors, but their avatars' fingers find nothing but smooth matte black. The tunnel system is accessible only to the Graveyard Daemons.\nAnd, incidentally, to Hiro. But he rarely uses it.\nThe Graveyard Daemons will take the avatar to the Pyre, an eternal, underground bonfire beneath the center of The Black Sun, and burn it As soon as the flames consume the avatar, it will vanish from the Metaverse, and then its owner will be able to sign on as usual, creating a new avatar to run around in. But, hopefully, he will be more cautious and polite the next time around.\n\n__________ Hiro looks up into the circle of applauding, whistling, and cheering avatars and notes that they are fading out The entire Black Sun now looks like it is being projected on gauze. On the other side of that gauze, bright lights shine through, overwhelming the image. Then it disappears entirely.\nHe peels off his goggles and finds himself standing in the parking lot of the U.Stor-It, holding a naked katana.\nThe sun has just gone down. A couple of dozen people are standing around him at a great distance, shielding themselves behind parked cars, awaiting his next move. Most of them are pretty scared, but a few of them are just plain excited.\nVitaly Chernobyl is standing in the open door of their 20-by. 30. His hairdo is backlighted. It has been petrified by means of egg whites and other proteins. These substances refract the light and throw off tiny little spectral fragments, a cluster-bombed rainbow. Right now, a miniature image of The Black Sun is being projected onto Vitaly's ass by Hiro's computer. He is rocking unsteadily from foot to foot, as though standing on both of them at the same time is too complicated to deal with this early in the day, and he hasn't decided which one to use.\n\"You're blocking me,\" Hiro says.\n\"It's time to go,\" Vitaly says.\n\"You're telling me it's time to go? I've been waiting for you to wake up for an hour.\"\nAs Hiro approaches, Vitaly watches his sword uncertainly. Vitaly's eyes are dry and red, and on his lower lip he is sporting a chancre the size of a tangerine.\n\"Did you win your sword fight?\"\n\"Of course I won the fucking sword fight,\" Fliro says. \"I'm the greatest sword fighter in the world.\"\n\"And you wrote the software.\"\n\"Yeah, That, too,\" Hiro says.\n\n_______ After Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns arrived in Long Beach on one of those hijacked ex-Soviet refugee freighters, they fanned out across southern California looking for expanses of reinforced concrete that were as vast and barren as the ones they had left behind in Kiev. They weren't homesick. They needed such environments in order to practice their art.\nThe L.A. River was a natural site. And there were plenty of nice overpasses. All they had to do was follow skateboarders to the secret places they had long since discovered. Thrashers and nuclear fuzz-grunge collectives thrive in the same environment. That's where Vitaly and Hiro are going right now.\nVitaly has a really old VW Vanagon, the kind with a pop-top that turns it into a makeshift camper. Vitaly used to live in it, staying on the street or in various Snooze 'n' Cruise franchises, until he met up with Hiro Protagonist. Now, the ownership of the Vanagon is subject to dispute, because Vitaly owes Hiro more money than it is technically worth. So they share it.\nThey drive the Vanagon around to the other side of the U-Stor-It, honking the horn and flashing the lights in order to shoo a hundred little kids away from the loading dock. It's not a playground, kids.\nThey pick their way down a broad corridor, excusing themselves every inch of the way as they step over little Mayan encampments and Buddhist shrines and white trash stoned on Vertigo, Apple Pie, Fuzzy Buzzy, Narthex, Mustard, and the like. The floor needs sweeping: used syringes, crack vials, charred spoons, pipe stems. There are also many little tubes, about thumb sized, transparent plastic with a red cap on one end. They might be crack vials, but the caps are still on them, and pipeheads wouldn't be so fastidious as to replace the lid on an empty vial. It must be something new Hiro hasn't heard of before, the McDonald's styrofoam burger box of drug containers.\nThey push through a fire door into another section of the U-Stor.It, which looks the same as the last one (everything looks the same in America, there are no transitions now). Vitaly owns the third locker on the right, a puny 5-by-lO that he is actually using for its intended purpose: storage.\nVitaly steps up to the door and commences trying to remember the combination to the padlock, which involves a certain amount of random guessing. Finally, the lock snaps and pops open. Vitaly shoots the bolt and swings the door open, sweeping a clean half-circle through the drug paraphernalia. Most of the 5-by-10 is occupied by a couple of large four-wheeled flatbed handcarts piled high with speakers and amps.\nHiro and Vitaly wheel the carts down to the loading dock, put the stuff into the Vanagon, and then return the empty carts to the 5-by-iD. Technically, the carts are community property, but no one believes that.\nThe drive to the scene of the concert is long, made longer by the fact that Vitaly, rejecting the technocentric L.A. view of the universe in which Speed is God, likes to stay on the surface and drive at about thirty-five miles per hour. Traffic is not great, either. So Hiro jacks his computer into the cigarette lighter and goggles into the Metaverse.\nHe is no longer connected to the network by a fiber-optic cable, and so all his communication with the outside world has to take place via radio waves, which are much slower and less reliable. Going into The Black Sun would not be practical-it would look and sound terrible, and the other patrons would look at him as if he were some kind of black-and-white person. But there's no problem with going into his office, because that's generated within the guts of his computer, which is sitting on his lap; he doesn't need any communication with the outside world for that.\nHe materializes in his office, in his nice little house in the old hacker neighborhood just off the Street. It is all quite Nipponese:\ntatami mats cover the floor. His desk is a great, ruddy slab of rough-sawn mahogany. Silvery cloud-light filters through rice-paper walls. A panel in front of him slides open to reveal a garden, complete with babbling brook and steelhead trout jumping out from time to time to grab flies. Technically speaking, the pond should be full of carp, but Hiro is American enough to think of carp as inedible dinosaurs that sit on the bottom and eat sewage.\nThere is something new: A globe about the size of a grapefruit, a perfectly detailed rendition of Planet Earth, hanging in space at arm's length in front of his eyes. Hiro has heard about this but never seen it It is a piece of CIC software called, simply, Earth. It is the user interface that CIC uses to keep track of every bit of spatial information that it owns-all the maps, weather data, architectural plans, and satellite surveillance stuff.\nHiro has been thinking that in a few years, if he does really well in the intel biz, maybe he will make enough money to subscribe to Earth and get this thing in his office. Now it is suddenly here, free of charge. The only explanation he can come up with is that Juanita must have given it to him.\nBut first things first. The Babel/Infocalypse card is still in his avatar's pocket. He takes it out.\nOne of the rice-paper panels that make up the walls of his office slides open. On the other side of it, Hiro can see a large, dimly lit room that wasn't there before; apparently Juanita came in and made a major addition to his house as well. A man walks into the office.\nThe Librarian daemon looks like a pleasant, fiftyish, silverhaired, bearded man with bright blue eyes, wearing a V-neck sweater over a work shirt, with a coarsely woven, tweedy-looking wool tie. The tie is loosened, the sleeves pushed up. Even though he's just a piece of software, he has reason to be cheerful; he can move through the nearly infinite stacks of information in the Library with the agility of a spider dancing across a vast web of cross-references. The Librarian is the only piece of CIC software that costs even more than Earth; the only thing he can't do is think.\n\"Yes, sir,\" the Librarian says. He is eager without being obnoxiously chipper, he clasps his hands behind his back, rocks forward slightly on the balls of his feet, raises his eyebrows expectantly over his half-glasses.\n\"Babel's a city in Babylon, right?\"\n\"It was a legendary city,\" the Librarian says. \"Babel is a Biblical term for Babylon. The word is Semitic; Bab means gate and El means Cod, so Babel means 'Gate of Cod.' But it is probably also somewhat onomatopoeic, imitating someone who speaks in an incomprehensible tongue. The Bible is full of puns.\"\n\"They built a tower to Heaven and God knocked it down.\"\n\"This is an anthology of common misconceptions. God did not do anything to the Tower itself. 'And the LORD said, \"Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them. Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.\" So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city. Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth.' Genesis 11:6-9, Revised Standard Version.\"\n\"So the tower wasn't knocked down. It just went on hiatus.\"\n\"Correct. It was not knocked down.\"\n\"But that's bogus?\"\n\"Bogus?\"\n\"Probably false. Juanita believes that nothing is provably true or provably false in the Bible. Because if it's provably false, then the Bible is a lie, and if it's provably true, then the existence of God is proven and there's no room for faith. The Babel story is provably false, because if they built a tower to Heaven and God didn't knock it down, then it would still be around somewhere, or at least a visible remnant of it.\"\n\"In assuming that it was very tall, you are relying on an obsolete reading. The tower is described, literally, as 'its top with the heavens.' For many centuries, this was interpreted to mean that its top was so high that it was in the heavens. But in the last century or so, as actual Babylonian ziggurats have been excavated, astrological diagrams-pictures of the heavens-have been found inscribed into their tops.\"\n\"Oh. Okay, so the real story is that a tower was built with heavenly diagrams carved into its top. Which is far more plausible than a tower that reaches to the heavens.\"\n\"More than plausible,\" the Librarian reminds him. \"Such structures have actually been found.\"\n\"Anyway, you're saying that when God got angry and came down on them, the tower itself wasn't affected. But they had to stop building the tower because of an informational disaster- they couldn't talk to each other.\"\n\"'Disaster' is an astrological term meaning 'bad star,\" the Librarian points out. \"Sorry--but due to my internal structure, I'm a sucker for non sequiturs.\"\n\"That's okay, really,\" Hiro says. \"You're a pretty decent piece of ware. Who wrote you, anyway?\"\n\"For the most part I write myself,\" the Librarian says. \"That is, I have the innate ability to learn from experience. But this ability was originally coded into me by my creator.\"\n\"Who wrote you? Maybe I know him,\" Hiro says. \"I know a lot of hackers.\"\n\"I was not coded by a professional hacker, per se, but by a researcher at the Library of Congress who taught himself how to code,\" the Librarian says. \"He devoted himself to the common problem of sifting through vast amounts of irrelevant detail in order to find significant gems of information. His name was Dr. Emanuel Lagos.\"\n\"I've heard the name,\" Hiro says. \"So he was kind of a metalibrarian. That's funny, I guessed he was one of those old CIA spooks who hangs around in the CIC.\"\n\"He never worked with the CIA.\"\n\"Okay. Let's get some work done. Look up every piece of free information in the Library that contains L. Bob Rife and arrange it in chronological order. The emphasis here is on free.\"\n\"Television and newspapers, yes, sir. One moment, sir,\" the Librarian says. He turns around and exits on crepe soles. Hiro turns his attention to Earth.\nThe level of detail is fantastic. The resolution, the clarity, just the look of it, tells Hiro, or anyone else who knows computers, that this piece of software is some heavy shit.\nIt's not just continents and oceans. It looks exactly like the earth would look from a point in geosynchronous orbit directly above L.A.. complete with weather systems--vast spinning galaxies of clouds, hovering just above the surface of the globe, casting gray shadows on the oceans-and polar ice caps, fading and fragmenting into the sea. Half of the globe is illuminated by sunlight, and half is dark. The terminator-the line between night and day-has just swept across L.A. and is now creeping across the Pacific, off to the west.\nEverything is going in slow motion. Hiro can see the clouds change shape if he watches them long enough. Looks like a clear night on the East Coast.\nSomething catches his attention, moving rapidly over the surface of the globe. He thinks it must be a gnat. But there are no gnats in the Metaverse. He tries to focus on it. The computer, bouncing low-powered lasers off his cornea, senses this change in emphasis, and then Hiro gasps as he seems to plunge downward toward the globe, like a space-walking astronaut who has just fallen out of his orbital groove. When he finally gets it under control, he's just a few hundred miles above the earth, looking down at a solid bank of clouds, and he can see the gnat gliding along below him. It's a low-flying CIC satellite, swinging north to south in a polar orbit.\n\"Your information, sir,\" the Librarian says.\nHiro startles and glances up. Earth swings down and out of his field of view and there is the Librarian, standing in front of the desk, holding out a hypercard. Like any librarian in Reality, this daemon can move around without audible footfalls.\n\"Can you make a little more noise when you walk? I'm easily startled,\" Hiro says.\n\"It is done, sir. My apologies.\"\nHiro reaches out for the hypercard. The Librarian takes half a step forward and leans toward him. This time, his foot makes a soft noise on the tatami mat, and Hiro can hear the white noise of his trousers sliding over his leg.\nHiro takes the hypercard and looks at it. The front is labeled\n***********************************\nResults of Library search on:\nRife, Lawrence Robert, 1948--\n***********************************\nHe flips the card over. The back is divided into several dozen fingernail-sized icons. Some of them are little snapshots of the front pages of newspapers. Many of them are colorful, glowing rectangles: miniature television screens showing live video.\n\"That's impossible,\" Hiro says. \"I'm sitting in a VW van, okay? I'm jacked in over a cellular link. You couldn't have moved that much video into my system that fast.\"\n\"It was not necessary to move anything,\" the Librarian says.\n\"All existing video on L. Bob Rife was collected by Dr. Lagos and placed in the Babel/Infocalypse stack, which you have in your system.\"\n\"Oh.\"\nCh. 14\nHiro stares at the miniature TV in the upper left corner of the card. It zooms toward him until it's about the size of a twelve-inch low-def television set at arm's length. Then the video image begins to play. It's very poor eight-millimeter film footage of a high school football game in the sixties. No soundtrack.\n\"What is this game?\"\nThe Librarian says, \"Odessa, Texas, 1965. L. Bob Rife is a fullback, number eight in the dark uniform.\"\n\"This is more detail than I need. Can you summarize some of these things?\"\n\"No. But I can list the contents briefly. The stack contains eleven high school football games. Rife was on the second-string Texas all-state team in his senior year. Then he proceeded to Rice on an academic scholarship and walked onto the football team, so there are also fourteen tapes of college games. Rife majored in communications.\"\n\"Logically enough, considering what he became.\"\n\"He became a television sports reporter in the Houston market, so there are fifty hours of footage from this period-mostly outtakes, of course. After two years in this line of work, Rife went into business with his great-uncle, a financier with roots in the oil business. The stack contains a few newspaper stories to that effect, which, as I note from reading them, are all textually related-implying that they came from the same source.\"\n\"A press release.\"\n\"Then there are no stories for five years.\"\n\"He was up to something.\"\n\"Then we begin to see more stories, mostly from the Religion sections of Houston newspapers, detailing Rife's contributions to various organizations.\"\n\"That sounded like summary to me. I thought you couldn't summarize.\"\n\"I can't really. I was quoting a summary that Dr. Lagos made to Juanita Marquez recently, in my presence, when they were reviewing the same data.\"\n\"Go on.\"\n\"Rife contributed $500 to the Highlands Church of the Baptism by Fire, Reverend Wayne Bedford, head minister; $2,500 to the Pentecostal Youth League of Bayside, Reverend Wayne Bedford, president; $150,000 to the Pentecostal Church of the New Trinity, Reverend Wayne Bedford, founder and patriarch; $2.3 million to Rife Bible College, Reverend Wayne Bedford, President and chairman of the theology department; $20 million to the archaeology department of Rife Bible College, plus $45 million to the astronomy department and $100 million to the computer science department.\"\n\"Did these donations take place before hyperinflation?\"\n\"Yes, sir. They were, as the expression goes, real money.\"\n\"That Wayne Bedford guy--is this the same Reverend Wayne who runs the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates?\"\n\"The same.\"\n\"Are you telling me that Rife owns the Reverend Wayne?\"\n\"He owns a majority share in Pearigate Associates, which is the multinational that runs the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates chain.\"\n\"Okay, let's keep sifting through this,\" Hiro says.\nHiro peeps out over his goggles to confirm that Vitaly is still nowhere near the concert. Then he dives back in and continues to go over the video and the news stories that Lagos has compiled.\nDuring the same years that Rife makes his contributions to the Reverend Wayne, he's showing up with increasing frequency in the business section, first in the local papers and later in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. There is a big flurry of publicity-obvious PR plants-after the Nipponese tried to use their old-boy network to shut him out of the telecommunications market there, and he took it to the American public, spending $10 million of his own money on a campaign to convince Americans that the Nipponese were duplicitous schemers. A triumphal cover on The Economist after the Nipponese finally knuckled under and let him corner the fiber-optics market in that country and, by extension, most of East Asia.\nFinally, then, the lifestyle pieces start coming in. L. Bob Rife has let his publicist know that he wants to show a more human side. There is a personality journalism program that does a puff piece on Rife after he buys a new yacht, surplus, from the U.S. Government.\nL. Bob Rife, last of the nineteenth-century monopolists, is shown consulting with his decorator in the captain's quarters. It looks nice as it is, considering that Rife bought this ship from the Navy, but it's not Texan enough for him. He wants it gutted and rebuilt. Then, shots of Rife maneuvering his steerlike body through the narrow passages and steep staircase of the ship's interior_typical boring gray steel Navy scape, which, he assures the interviewer, he is going to have spruced up considerably.\n\"Y'know, there's a story that when Rockefeller bought himself a yacht, he bought a pretty small one, like a seventy-footer or something. Small by the standards of the day. And when someone asked him why he went and bought himself such a dinky little yacht, he just looked at the guy and said, 'What do you think l am, a Vanderbilt?' Haw! Well, anyway, welcome aboard my yacht.\"\nL. Bob Rife says this while standing on a huge open-air platform elevator along with the interviewer and the whole camera crew. The elevator is going up. In the background is the Pacific Ocean. As Rife is speaking the last part of the line, suddenly the elevator rises up to the top and the camera turns around, and we are looking out across the deck of the aircraft carrier Enterprise, formerly of the U.S. Navy, now the personal yacht of L. Bob Rife, who beat out both General Jim's Defense System and Admiral Bob's Global Security in a furious bidding war. L. Bob Rife proceeds to admire the vast, flat open spaces of the carrier's flight deck, likening it to certain parts of Texas. He suggests that it would be amusing to cover part of it with dirt and raise cattle there.\nAnother profile, this one shot for a business network, apparently made somewhat later: Back on the Enterprise, where the captain's office has been massively reworked. L. Bob Rife, Lord of Bandwidth, is sitting behind his desk, having his mustache waxed. Not in the sense that women have their legs waxed. He's having the curl smoothed out and restored. The waxer is a very short Asian woman who does itso delicately that it doesn't even interfere with his talking, mostly about his efforts to extend his cable TV network throughout Korea and into China and link it up with his big fiber-optic trunk line that runs across Siberia and over the Urals.\n\"Yeah, you know, a monopolist's work is never done. No such thing as a perfect monopoly. Seems like you can never get that last one-tenth of one percent.\"\n\"Isn't the government still strong in Korea? You must have more trouble with regulations there.\"\nL. Bob Rife laughs. \"Y'know, watching government regulators trying to keep up with the world is my favorite sport. Remember when they busted up Ma Bell?\"\n\"Just barely.\" The reporter is a woman in her twenties.\n\"You know what it was, right?\"\n\"Voice communications monopoly.\"\n\"Right. They were in the same business as me. The information business. Moving phone conversations around on little tiny copper wires, one at a time. Government busted them up-at the same time when I was starting cable TV franchises in thirty states. Haw! Can you believe that? It's like if they figured out a way to regulate horses at the same time the Model T and the airplane were being introduced.\"\n\"But a cable TV system isn't the same as a phone system.\"\n\"At that stage it wasn't, cause it was just a local system. But once you get local systems all over the world, all you got to do is hook 'em together and it's a global network. Just as big as the phone system. Except this one carries information ten thousand times faster. It carries images, sound, data, you name it.\"\n\n__________ A naked PR plant, a half-hour television commercial with no purpose whatsoever other than to let L. Bob Rife tell his side of a particular issue. It seems that a number of Rife's programmers, the people who made his systems run, got together and formed a union-unheard of, for hackers-and filed a suit against Rife, claiming that he had placed audio and video bugs in their homes, in fact placed all of them under twenty-four-hour surveillance, and harassed and threatened some programmers who were making what he called \"unacceptable lifestyle choices.\" For example, when one of his programmers and her husband engaged in oral sex in their own bedroom one night, the next morning she was called into Rife's office, where he called her a slut and a sodomite and told her to clean out her desk. The bad publicity from this so annoyed Rife that he felt the need to blow a few million on some more PR.\n\"I deal in information,\" he says to the smarmy, toadying pseudojournalist who \"interviews\" him. He's sitting in his office in Houston, looking slicker than normal. \"All television going out to Consumers throughout the world goes through me. Most of the information transmitted to and from the CIC database passes through my networks. The Metaverse-the entire Street-exists by virtue of a network that I own and control.\n\"But that means, if you'll just follow my reasoning for a bit, that when I have a programmer working under me who is working with that information, he is wielding enormous power. Information is going into his brain. And it's staying there. It travels with him when he goes home at night. It gets all tangled up into his dreams, for Christ's sake. He talks to his wife about it. And, goddamn it, he doesn't have any right to that information. If I was running a car factory, I wouldn't let workers drive the cars home or borrow tools. But that's what I do at five o'clock each day, all over the world, when my hackers go home from work.\n\"When they used to hang rustlers in the old days, the last thing they would do is piss their pants. That was the ultimate sign, you see, that they had lost control over their own bodies, that they were about to die. See, it's the first function of any organization to control its own sphincters. We're not even doing that. So we're working on refining our management techniques so that we can control that information no matter where it is-on our hard disks or even inside the programmers' heads. Now, I can't say more because I got competition to worry about. But it is my fervent hope that in five or ten years, this kind of thing won't even be an issue.\"\n\n___________ A half-hour episode of a science news program, this one on the controversial new subject of infoastronomy, the search for radio signals coming from other solar systems. L. Bob Rife has taken a personal interest in the subject; as various national governments auction off their possessions, he has purchased a string of radio observatories and hooked them together, using his fabled fiber-optic net, to turn them into a single giant antenna as big as the whole earth. He is scanning the skies twenty.four hours a day, looking for radio waves that mean something-radio waves carrying information from other civilizations. And why, asks the interviewer-a celebrity professor from MIT-why would a simple oilman be interested in such a high. flown, abstract pursuit?\n\"I just about got this planet all sewn up.\"\nRife delivers this line with an incredibly sardonic and contemptuous twang, the exaggerated accent of a cowboy who suspects that some Yankee pencilneck is looking down his nose at him.\n\n___________ Another news piece, this one apparently done a few years later. Again we are on the Enterprise, but this time the atmosphere is different again. The top deck has been turned into an open-air refugee camp. It is swarming with Bangladeshis that L. Bob Rife plucked out of the Bay of Bengal after their country washed into the ocean in a series of massive floods, caused by ieforestation farther upstream in India-hydrological warfare. The camera pans to look out over the edge of the flight deck, and Iown below, we see the first beginnings of the Raft: a relatively small collection of a few hundred boats that have glommed onto the Enterprise, hoping for a free ride across to America.\nRife's walking among the people, handing out Bible comics and kisses to little kids. They cluster around with broad smiles, pressing their palms together and bowing. Rife bows back, very awkwardly, but there's no gaiety on his face. He's deadly serious.\n\"Mr. Rife, what's your opinion of the people who say you're just doing this as a self-aggrandizing publicity stunt?\" This interviewer is trying to be more of a Bad Cop.\n\"Shit, if! took time out to have an opinion about everything, I wouldn't get any work done,\" L. Bob Rife says. \"You should ask these people what they think.\"\n\"You're telling me that this refugee assistance program has nothing to do with your public image?\"\n\"Nope. L--\"\nThere's an edit and they cut away to the journalist, pontificating into the camera. Rife was on the verge of delivering a sermon, Hiro senses, but they cut him off.\nBut one of the true glories of the Library is that it has so many outtakes. Just because a piece of videotape never got edited into a broadcast program doesn't mean it's devoid of intel value. CIC long ago stuck its fingers into the networks' videotape libraries. All of those outtakes-millions of hours of footage-have not actually been uploaded to the Library in digital form yet. But you can send in a request, and CIC will go and pull that videotape off the shelf for you and play it back.\nLagos has already done it. The tape is right there.\n\"Nope. Look. The Raft is a media event. But in a much more profound, general sense than you can possibly imagine.\"\n\"Oh.\"\n\"It's created by the media in that without the media, people wouldn't know it was here, Refus wouldn't come out and glom onto it the way they do. And it sustains the media. It creates a lot of information flow--movies, news reports--you know.\"\n\"So you're creating your own news event to make money off the information flow that it creates?\" says the journalist, desperately trying to follow. His tone of voice says that this is all a waste of videotape. His weary attitude suggests that this is not the first time Rife has flown off on a bizarre tangent.\n\"Partly. But that's only a very crude explanation. It really goes a lot deeper than that. You've probably heard the expression that the Industry feeds off of biomass, like a whale straining krill from the ocean.\"\n\"I've heard the expression, yes.\"\n\"That's my expression. I made it up. An expression like that is just like a virus, you know-it's a piece of information-data--that spreads from one person to the next Well, the function of the Raft is to bring more biomass. To renew America. Most countries are static, all they need to do is keep having babies. But America's like this big old clanking, smoking machine that just lumbers across the landscape scooping up and eating everything in sight. Leaves behind a trail of garbage a mile wide. Always needs more fueL Ever read the story about the labyrinth and the minotaur?\"\n\"Sure. That was on Crete, right?\" The journalist only answers out of sarcasm; he can't believe he's here listening to this, he wants to fly back to L.A. yesterday.\n\"Yeah. Every year, the Greeks had to pony up a few virgins and send them to Crete as tribute. Then the king put them into the labyrinth, and the minotaur ate them up. I used to read that story when I was a kid and wonder who the hell these guys were, on Crete, that everyone else was so scared of them that they would just meekly give up their children to be eaten, every year. They must have been some mean sons of bitches.\n\"Now I have a different perspective on it. America must look, to those poor little buggers down there, about the same as Crete looked to those poor Greek suckers. Except that there's no coerdon involved. Those people down there give up their children willingly. Send them into the labyrinth by the millions to be eaten up. The Industry feeds on them and spits back images, sends out movies and TV programs, over my networks, images of wealth and exotic things beyond their wildest dreams, back to those people, and it gives them something to dream about, something to aspire to. And that is the function of the Raft. It's just a big old krill carrier.\"\nFinally the journalist gives up on being a journalist, just starts to slag L. Bob Rife openly. He's had it with this guy. \"That's disgusting. I can't believe you can think about people that way.\"\n\"Shit, boy, get down off your high horse. Nobody really gets eaten. It's just a figure of speech. They come here, they get decent jobs, find Christ, buy a Weber grill, and live happily ever after. What's wrong with that?\"\nRife is pissed. He's yelling. Behind him, the Bangladeshis are picking up on his emotional vibes and becoming upset themselves. Suddenly, one of them, an incredibly gaunt man with a long drooping mustache, runs in front of the camera and begins to shout: \"a ma la ge zen ba dam gal nun ka aria su su na an da. . .\"\nThe sounds spread from him to his neighbors, spreading across the flight deck like a wave.\n\"Cut,\" the journalist says, turning into the camera. \"Just cut. The Babble Brigade has started up again.\"\nThe soundtrack now consists of a thousand people speaking in tongues under the high-pitched, shit-eating chuckles of L. Bob Rife.\n\"This is the miracle of tongues,\" Rife shouts above the tumult. \"I can understand every word these people are saying. Can you, brother?\"\n\n____________ As Hiro and Vitaly approach the vast freeway overpass where tonight's concert is to take place, the solid ferrous quality of the Vanagon attracts MagriaPoons like a Twinkie draws cockroaches. If they knew that Vitaly Chernobyl himself was in the van, they'd go crazy, they'd stall the van's engine. But right now, they'll poon anything that might be headed toward the concert.\nWhen they get closer to the overpass, it becomes a lost cause trying to drive at all, the thrashers are so thick and numerous. It's like putting on crampons and trying to walk through a room full of puppies. They have to nose their way along, tapping the horn, flashing the lights.\nFinally, they get to the flatbed semi that constitutes the stage for tonight's concert. Next to it is another semi, full of amps and other sound gear. The drivers of the trucks, an oppressed minority of two, have retreated into the cab of the sound truck to smoke cigarettes and glare balefully at the swarm of thrashers, their sworn enemies in the food chain of the highways. They will not voluntarily come out until five in the morning, when the way has been made plain.\nA couple of the other Meltdowns are standing around smoking cigarettes, holding them between two fingers in the Slavic style, like darts. They stomp the cigarettes out on the concrete with their cheap vinyl shoes, run up to the Vanagon, and begin to haul out the sound equipment. Vitaly puts on goggles, hooks himself into a computer on the sound truck, and begins tuning the system. There's a 3-D model of the overpass already in memory. He has to figure out how to sync the delays on all the different speaker clusters to maximize the number of nasty, clashing echoes.",

I just want you to tune in to that for a moment of just saying, \"God, I thank You for the Cross.\" There's no one like You, Jesus. Thank You, Lord. We press into You tonight, Lord. We love Your presence, we love You, we love You\n\nThe moon and stars they wept\nThe morning sun was dead\nThe Savior of the world was fallen\nHis body on the cross\nHis blood poured out for us\nThe weight of every curse upon him\n\nOne final breath He gave\nAs Heaven looked away\nThe Son of God was laid in darkness\nA battle in the grave\nThe war on death was waged\nThe power of hell forever broken\n\nThe ground began to shake\nThe stone was rolled away\nHis perfect love could not be overcome\nNow death where is your sting\nOur resurrected King has rendered you defeated\n\nForever, He is glorified\nForever, He is lifted high\nForever, He is risen\nHe is alive\nHe is alive\n\nThe ground began to shake\nThe stone was rolled away\nHis perfect love could not be overcome\nNow death where is your sting\nOur resurrected King has rendered you defeated\n\nForever, He is glorified\nForever, He is lifted high\nForever, He is risen\nHe is alive\nHe is alive\n\nYou have overcome\nYour resurrected King\nYou have overcome the grave\nYou have overcome\n\nWe sing Hallelujah, we sing Hallelujah\nWe sing Hallelujah, the Lamb has overcome\nWe sing Hallelujah, we sing Hallelujah\nWe sing Hallelujah, the Lamb has overcome\nWe sing Hallelujah, we sing Hallelujah\nWe sing Hallelujah, the Lamb has overcome\nWe sing Hallelujah, we sing Hallelujah\nWe sing Hallelujah, the Lamb has overcome\nWe sing Hallelujah, we sing Hallelujah\nWe sing Hallelujah, the Lamb has overcome\nWe sing Hallelujah, we sing Hallelujah\nWe sing Hallelujah, the Lamb has overcome\n\nForever, He is glorified\nForever, He is lifted high\nForever, He is risen\nHe is alive\nHe is alive\nForever, He is glorified\nForever, He is lifted high\nForever, He is risen\nHe is alive\nHe is alive",
