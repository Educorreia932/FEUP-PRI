I will make my own decisions\nI’m on a permanent holiday\nI’m going outside to play\nI ain’t gonna slave away\nNot for no corporate babylon\nI’m never gonna be a pawn in their manipulation games\nOh Lord I’m taking the reins\nI’m breaking the chains\nI’m never gonna kneel, no way\nMy prophet is Heaven sent\nNo preacher or president can lead I astray\nThey’ll never know. I’m taking Jah highway home\nI’ll never go astray\nI’m leaving the past\nAnd forwarding fast\n’cause freedom is here to stay\nOh Lord we got to take back the knowledge\nWe got to take back the power\nWe got to take back the knowledge\nWe got to take back the power\nWe got to take back the knowledge\nTo take back the power\nTake back what they have stolen from our hearts\nAnd we got to take back the esoteric knowledge\nOhh Lord for too long they’ve been keeping us apart\nOhh yes, we got to take back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour\nTake back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour\nTake back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour\nTake back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour\nTake back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour\nTake back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour\nTake back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour\nTake back the knowledge, take back the power, humanity don’t let this be our final hour\nTake back the knowledge\nTake back the power",
